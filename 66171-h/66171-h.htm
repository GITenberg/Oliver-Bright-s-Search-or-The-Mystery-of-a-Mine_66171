<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION.</h2>
</div>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Oliver Bright’s Search</span>,” the second volume of
the “Bound to Succeed” Series, relates the adventures
of a manly American youth who goes West to locate a
mine in which his invalid father owns a large interest.
Oliver is just out of school, and has but little experience
in travelling, yet he does not hesitate to take
the trip to California, by way of the Isthmus of Panama,
and thence into the interior on horseback.</p>

<p>Oliver is, in every respect, an up-to-date boy; one
who will stand no nonsense when dealing with those
who would defraud his father out of his lawful property;
yet the boy’s moral principles are of a high order,
and he is not unmerciful when the object of his long
search has been gained.</p>

<p>It was hoped, when the book was first issued, that
the story would stand well beside “Richard Dare’s
Venture,” which had preceded it. It has been even
more successful than the other volume named, and
once more the author must thank the readers and
critics who have taken such an interest in what he has
written.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the author would say a word in regard
to the scenes in the mining districts of California.
These were drawn very largely from the narratives of
a close and dear relative who spent much time out
there, going as an Argonaut of ’49, and to whom the
vicinity of Sutter’s Mill and the Mokelumne River
became as an open book, not only then but later on.
To write down these descriptions was, therefore, not
only a work of interest, but of love.</p>

<p class="noi title">OLIVER BRIGHT’S SEARCH.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.<br />
<small>AN UNEXPECTED DISCLOSURE.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“If you please, Master Oliver, your father wishes
to see you at once,” said Donald, the man of all work,
as he entered the summer-house where Oliver Bright
sat poring over a volume of travels.</p>

<p>“What does he want of me?” asked the youth, as
he reluctantly closed the book.</p>

<p>“He didn’t say; but he wants you to come at once.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Donald; where is he?”</p>

<p>“In the library.”</p>

<p>Oliver rose to his feet somewhat slowly. He was
in no humor just then to face his respected sire. A
few words will explain why.</p>

<p>Oliver was afraid he was in for a lecture, and
perhaps worse. He was not a boy of bad disposition,
but for once the combination of circumstances had led
him into serious difficulty.</p>

<p>Oliver was a student at the Rockvale Academy, also
catcher for the local baseball nine. Two days before,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
on the very afternoon that the nine was to play
an important game with the club from Elmport,
Oliver had been kept in by Dr. Tangus for a supposed
fault of which he was not guilty. This had angered
Oliver, and as his particular chum, Gus Gregory,
was kept in at the same time, the two planned
to “get square,” as they termed it.</p>

<p>Their plan of action was simple and harmless
enough, but it bore grievous results. Gus proposed
to take the doctor’s pet calf from her pasture and
lead her into the schoolroom, and Oliver agreed
that if this was done he would make the old cow
follow.</p>

<p>At dead of night the two boys started to carry out
their plan. But both the calf and the cow made such
a noise that the doctor’s whole household was aroused,
and the two boys had to run for it.</p>

<p>In making their escape Gus Gregory had stumbled
over a hothouse bed, smashing a dozen panes of
glass or more, thus provoking a shot from the doctor’s
hired man, who imagined burglars were around.</p>

<p>When Oliver reached home he found he had quite
a severe cut upon his left hand, obtained in his effort
to help Gus out of the hotbed frame.</p>

<p>In the morning the wound, despite the fact that he
had bathed it in arnica, appeared as bad as ever. But
Oliver did not dare to ask permission to remain at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
home, and so set out for the academy in anything
but a cheerful mood.</p>

<p>Gus Gregory met him at the gate with a long-drawn
face; and small wonder.</p>

<p>Dr. Tangus had found them out. Gus had dropped
his note-book in the hotbed and the gardener had
picked it up. In a terrible rage, the doctor soon
after called at the Gregory home, and forced a full
confession from Gus. Mr. Gregory had promised to
pay his full share of the damage done, and to bring
his son to account, and the doctor left saying he
would call on Oliver’s father later.</p>

<p>When Oliver entered the academy he was at once
called aside by the doctor. But little was said; Dr.
Tangus merely stating what he had discovered, and
declaring his intention to settle the matter outside
of the school.</p>

<p>This had happened Friday morning. It was now
Saturday, and Oliver firmly believed that the hour
of retribution had come. He took all the time possible
to walk up the gravel path and through the
broad hall, and hesitated several seconds before turning
the handle of the library door.</p>

<p>When he entered the room he found his father
seated at the desk, his forehead resting on his hand.
Mr. Bright was a man well past the middle age of
life, and somewhat broken down in health.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>He was tall and slender, with brown hair and eyes.
His manner as a general rule was gentle, and as
Oliver gazed at his parent, his heart smote him for
the trouble he had brought about.</p>

<p>“You sent for me, father,” he said, as he stopped
by the door.</p>

<p>Mr. Bright started up from the revery into which
he had fallen.</p>

<p>“Yes, Oliver,” he replied. “Come in and sit down.
I want to have a talk with you.”</p>

<p>The boy did as requested, taking a chair that stood
in the bay-window at the farther end of the room.
He could not help but look at his father closely.
Surely he did not appear to be much provoked over
what had occurred.</p>

<p>“Come closer, Oliver; here, take this chair by my
side,” went on Mr. Bright. “I do not wish any one
to overhear what I have to say.”</p>

<p>The boy took the seat indicated. Then for the
first time he noticed how careworn his father appeared.
There were numerous wrinkles upon Mr.
Bright’s brow and his eyes were sunken and troubled.</p>

<p>“You are nearly seventeen years old, I believe,”
began Mr. Bright after a moment of silence.</p>

<p>“I’ll be seventeen next May,” replied the boy,
relieved at being asked such an ordinary question.</p>

<p>“And your term at the academy closes next month,
I believe?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir; three weeks from yesterday.”</p>

<p>“And when you have finished your course there
have you thought of what was to be done next?”</p>

<p>“Why I thought I was to go to college,” said
Oliver, somewhat astonished at the question. “Of
course you didn’t say I was to go; but all the others
were going, and—”</p>

<p>“It was my full intention to have you go, Oliver.
But circumstances will make a change necessary. I
hate to disappoint you, but I am afraid it cannot
be helped.” And Mr. Bright turned away his face.</p>

<p>Oliver’s heart grew cold in an instant. Give up
going to college! Give it up after having anticipated
it so long, after having talked it over so many times
with the other boys! Surely his father intended to
punish him too severely altogether.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t say that, father!” he cried. “I will
try to do better in the future! I did not mean to
do so wrong! I—I did not stop to think.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bright straightened up and looked at his son
curiously.</p>

<p>“What are you talking about, Oliver?” he asked.
“I am not finding fault with the way you have conducted
yourself at the academy. In fact, I must
congratulate you on the general excellence of the reports
Dr. Tangus sends in. By the last I see that
you stood next to the highest in the class, and that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
counts for much where there are so many bright boys.
I have no doubt that the doctor is proud of you.”</p>

<p>Oliver was completely mystified by this speech.
It was evident that his father knew nothing concerning
what had taken place. The boy gave an inward
groan as he thought of what a change there
would be when exposure came.</p>

<p>“Then Dr. Tangus has not been here?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No. What put that in your head?”</p>

<p>“I thought he had come to report me.”</p>

<p>“No; I have not seen the doctor in a month,
though I expect him to call soon.” Oliver started.
“I have had no reasons to find fault with you for
the way in which you conduct yourself. The trouble
in this case comes from an entirely different quarter.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bright paused. Oliver noted that there was
a slight quiver in his father’s voice. Surely something
quite out of the ordinary was wrong.</p>

<p>“You are the only one who is left to me, Oliver,”
Mr. Bright continued. “It was always my intention
to give you the best education that money can buy,
for I know the value of such, and then give you a
first-class start in whatever professional pursuit you
might choose to enter. But now, my poor boy”—</p>

<p>Mr. Bright broke off short.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, father?” cried Oliver. “Why
cannot you do as you intended? I thought sure I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
would go to college and then, after perhaps a year
or so of traveling, I would settle down and become
a lawyer—that is, if you thought I was smart
enough.”</p>

<p>“That programme would have suited me exactly,
Oliver. Your Uncle William was a lawyer, and you
take after him a good deal. But now it cannot be
thought of.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Ah, it is a bitter story, my boy, and I do not see
how I can tell it to you. I was very blind and foolish,
trusting those that were not worthy of my confidence,
and now both of us must suffer for it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“And perhaps you never will, quite. I was never
of a speculative nature; but this was apparently so
easy, and so sure to turn out profitably, that I entered
into it without due consideration.”</p>

<p>“It is money-matters, then, father, that makes
you say that I must change my plans; must give
up thinking of going to college, and all that?” faltered
Oliver.</p>

<p>“<a href="#i_fp010">Yes, Oliver, alas!</a> yes.” Mr. Bright heaved a
deep sigh. “<a href="#i_fp010">I am ruined</a>; I am not worth a dollar
in the world!” he added.</p>

<small>THE STORY OF THE AURORA MINE.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Oliver Bright was greatly astonished by his
father’s disclosure. There had been nothing said or
done heretofore to indicate that Mr. Arthur Bright
was on the brink of financial disaster. The two had
lived in exceedingly comfortable, if not elegant,
style, and the boy was granted every reasonable
desire.</p>

<p>“You are ruined?” he repeated, with eyes wide
open at the announcement.</p>

<p>“Yes, Oliver, completely ruined. This very roof
that shelters us is no longer my own.”</p>

<p>“And is there no hope?”</p>

<p>Mr. Bright shook his head.</p>

<p>“I have hoped, until now; all hope is useless—that
is”—and the man paused.</p>

<p>“What, father? What is the chance?” asked the
boy eagerly.</p>

<p>“It is hardly worth considering, Oliver, it is so
small. We had better face the truth, bitter as it is.”</p>

<p>Oliver drew a long breath. To endure poverty
is no pleasant thing, especially when one has once<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
been rich. The boy was so completely taken aback
that for a moment he did not say a word.</p>

<p>“I should have spoken of this before and prepared
you for its coming,” went on Mr. Bright; “but
day after day I trusted that matters would take a
better turn and all would be right. I am to blame
there.”</p>

<p>“Never mind; you did what you thought was
right,” responded Oliver as bravely as he could. “But
I wish I had known; I would not have laid so many
plans for the future. I might have got ready to go
to work instead.”</p>

<p>“I have not yet decided what I shall do when we
leave this home. I have been out of active business
so long that I suppose it will come hard to resume
it again. Perhaps I will go back to the book business,
that is, if I can find a suitable opening.”</p>

<p>Oliver looked at his father in dismay. For a man
in Mr. Bright’s state of health to go back to active
life after a retirement of eight years would be hard
indeed.</p>

<p>“I wish I knew something of the book business;
I’d sail right in and work for both of us,” he declared
with considerable vim. “But I don’t know
the first thing about business of any kind,” he added
with a sigh.</p>

<p>“You are bright by nature as well as by name,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
Oliver,” said his father with a faint smile. “I think
you will stand a fair chance of making your way.”</p>

<p>“I hope so. Any way, I intend to try. But,
father, won’t you tell me something of your affairs?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Oliver; I intend to tell you as much as
you can understand. It may prove a useful lesson
to you.” Mr. Bright ran his hand over his forehead
as if to collect his thoughts. “About a year after
I sold out my interest in the Franklin Book Company
and settled here, I became acquainted with Colonel
Mendix. Do you remember him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. He was a dark, Spanish gentleman,
with a heavy black beard.”</p>

<p>“You are right, saving that he was far from being
a gentleman, though I did not know that at the time.
This Mendix was introduced to me by James Barr, an
intimate friend of mine, who was a surveyor and who
had become interested in several mining schemes.”</p>

<p>“I remember him also.”</p>

<p>“This Mendix visited me several times, and finally
unfolded to me a simple plan for making a fortune
on the outlay of a comparatively small sum of money.
As you say, he was of Spanish descent, his people
coming from some place in South America. He had
also a number of relatives among the early settlers in
California, who, you know, settled there before the
gold fever broke out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I have heard of those Spanish settlements.”</p>

<p>“Colonel Mendix said that among these relatives
were two old men who had in their possession a paper
containing the full directions for reaching and locating
a very valuable mine somewhere up among the
mountains. These two men were too old to work the
mine themselves, and they were willing to sell out
their secret and rights for ten thousand dollars, to be
paid when the mine was located and found to be as
they represented.”</p>

<p>“What was the mine supposed to be worth?” asked
Oliver with interest.</p>

<p>“Colonel Mendix placed its value at not less than
seventy-five thousand dollars, and said it might be
worth several hundred thousand.”</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder he didn’t buy the mine himself,
without saying anything about it.”</p>

<p>“He said he had not the cash, and he did not wish
to apply to any of his Spanish friends for fear they
would make inquiries and buy the mine for themselves.
Mendix was a very plausible talker, and before
I was aware of what I was doing, I had agreed
to advance the money, stipulating, however, that
James Barr should be the one to locate the mine
and determine its value. I had known Barr so long
that I felt sure I could trust him.</p>

<p>“Well, the contract was drawn up and signed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
By it Mendix was to have a quarter interest in the
Aurora Mine, as we had christened it, and James
Barr was to have an eighth. The remainder was to
be mine. I was to advance the purchasing money
as well as the cash to open up the place, either to
work it ourselves or place it on the market. Do
you follow, Oliver?”</p>

<p>“Easily enough; it’s as plain as day.”</p>

<p>“As soon as this was done, Mendix and Barr set
out for California. Two months later I received word
that they had obtained the directions and were about
setting out for the mine, which was located somewhere
back of a place called Sutter’s Mill.</p>

<p>“Four months passed. Then came a long letter
from Mendix and a note from Barr. The mine had
been found even better than represented, and they
wished to close the bargain at once, and asked me
to forward a draft for five thousand dollars additional,
which they intended to use in purchasing the machinery
of an abandoned mine some ten miles distant,
and have it transported to the Aurora. The outlook
seemed so favorable that I complied without hesitation.</p>

<p>“Another letter came a month later from Mendix,
saying the mine had been opened, but that another
five thousand dollars would be needed to put in additional
machinery for draining the water and crushing
the rock. This I also paid, although in order to do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
it I was compelled to take a mortgage on this place
for three thousand.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you have other money?”</p>

<p>“Only in stocks, and those I did not care to sell
as they were then low and I thought they would
rise. I found that Dr. Tangus had money to loan,
and so I went to him.”</p>

<p>“Dr. Tangus!” cried Oliver, thinking of what
was to come.</p>

<p>“Yes. He let me have the money and took a
mortgage on this place. The money fell due last
week, and yesterday I received a note from the
doctor asking for payment.”</p>

<p>Oliver gave a groan. Was it possible his own doings
had hurried Dr. Tangus’s actions?</p>

<p>“And you cannot pay him?”</p>

<p>“No. But I am ahead of my story. Time went
on and I heard no more from the mine. I wrote to
Mendix and to Barr, but received no reply. Then
came a draft for four thousand dollars to pay for
some more machinery Mendix had ordered. I paid
the claim, but immediately sent word not to contract
any more debts, as I would not pay them, and
demanding an accounting.</p>

<p>“None came, and I sent an agent to San Francisco
to find out how matters stood. At the end of two
months I received word from this man, Bentwell,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
and also from Mendix, that the mine had become
flooded with water, that it could not be drained, and
that in making surveys of the place James Barr had
been drowned.</p>

<p>“This news was so disheartening I knew not what
to do. I was out twenty-four thousand dollars, and
had not a thing to show for it. I was on the point
of starting for California myself when a friend of
Mendix appeared on the scene.</p>

<p>“This man had been out to the mine, and knew
all about it. He said the Aurora was utterly worthless,
that Mendix had at last found it so, and that
the man had left in disgust for South America. Private
creditors had levied upon such machinery as was
above ground, and that I might as well give up all
hope of ever receiving a dollar out of the thing.</p>

<p>“This news all but prostrated me; for in the meanwhile
stocks here in the East were declining rapidly.
I kept up as long as I could, but now it is no use to
do so longer. As I said before, every dollar is gone.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bright turned away to hide his emotion. The
story had been a hard one to tell. Oliver knew not
what to say.</p>

<p>At this juncture there was a knock at the door,
and Mrs. Hanson, the housekeeper, appeared.</p>

<p>“Dr. Tangus is here to see you,” she said to Mr.
Bright.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />
<small>MR. BRIGHT’S RESOLVE.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The announcement that Dr. Tangus had come to
see his father filled Oliver Bright with dismay. Considering
the story he would have to tell, the doctor’s
arrival at any time would have been unpleasant for
the boy, but under existing circumstances it was a
thing to be dreaded. What would his father think
when the whole miserable story came to light?</p>

<p>And yet, if it must be told, he wished that his
father should first hear it from his own lips. He
knew the doctor could turn the case so that it might
look very black indeed.</p>

<p>Therefore, before Mr. Bright had time to tell the
housekeeper to show the schoolmaster in, the boy
leaned over and whispered,—</p>

<p>“I would like to speak a few words with you
before the doctor comes in.”</p>

<p>His father nodded, thinking that his son wished
to continue the conversation that had just been interrupted.</p>

<p>“Take the doctor in the parlor, Mrs. Hanson,” he
said. “Say I will see him in a moment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Hanson at once disappeared. When the two
were left alone Mr. Bright looked at Oliver inquiringly.</p>

<p>“There is nothing more to tell,” he said; “Dr. Tangus’s
visit caps the climax. He, no doubt, has called
for his money; and unless I get an extension of time
in which to pay up, the matter will be put into the
sheriff’s hands, and the place will be sold.”</p>

<p>“It is too bad,” returned the boy. “But there is
something else I wish to speak about.” He colored
up painfully. “I did not think so much of it at
the time—that is, I did not think it was so wicked
a deed to do. When I came in I thought Dr. Tangus
had been here and told you all about it.”</p>

<p>“About what?”</p>

<p>In a few words, and with a very troubled look
upon his face, Oliver told his tale. Mr. Bright
listened in silence.</p>

<p>“I know now just how bad and senseless a thing
it was to do,” said the boy, at the conclusion.</p>

<p>“I trust you do,” replied his father. “Pranks of
that kind to my mind show only a lack of wit. You
ought to be above such things, Oliver.” Mr. Bright
heaved a sigh. “I am afraid this will tend to make
the doctor stiff in his demands. I thought the tone
of yesterday’s letter was rather severe.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid so too.” Oliver bit his lip in vexation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
“I wish he had punished me in school instead.
It isn’t fair to make you suffer for what I have
done!” he cried.</p>

<p>“When we do wrong we are not always sure who
will suffer for it. But we will say no more about
it. What I have revealed will be punishment enough
for you. Now I must go; it will not do to keep
the doctor waiting any longer.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bright rose and left the library. Oliver remained
where he sat, his chin resting in the palm
of his hand.</p>

<p>What a change had taken place since he had
entered that room only a short hour before! He
had thought himself a well-to-do boy, with every
prospect of a brilliant future; now he knew he was
as poor as the humblest lad in Rockvale. Instead
of going to college and taking things easy for a year
or so thereafter, he must roll up his sleeves and go to
work. What had brought this great change about?</p>

<p>Carefully he reviewed all the facts which his father
had related. Not an incident was forgotten. He
wished he had the letters from California to read
over; they might contain some particulars his father
had forgotten to mention.</p>

<p>“I would like to see that Aurora mine, and satisfy
myself that everything is as this Colonel Mendix
claimed,” he thought. “He was a thorough sharper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
in my opinion; and if I was father I would not take
his word for the matter.”</p>

<p>His thoughts were interrupted by the entrance of
Mr. Bright, accompanied by Dr. Tangus, a stout and
highly important looking individual.</p>

<p>Oliver rose and greeted the visitor, offering him a
chair at the same time, his face flushing the while.
Dr. Tangus looked at him sharply.</p>

<p>“Well, young man, your father tells me you have
told him of your mischief-making,” began the schoolmaster.</p>

<p>“Yes, doctor; and I am quite sorry for what I have
done.”</p>

<p>“Humph! boys generally are after they are found
out,” sniffed the learned gentleman. “However, now
that you have told your father, I intend to leave
the case in his hands. You are generally a pretty
good boy, and I am sorry you have broken your
record.”</p>

<p>Oliver did not reply, and the doctor turned to Mr.
Bright.</p>

<p>“Then you will grant me an extension of time?”
asked the latter anxiously.</p>

<p>“I will give you two months, Mr. Bright,” was
the somewhat slow response; “but more than that I
cannot do. If at the end of that time you cannot
pay I will foreclose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>“Very well, we will so understand it,” said Oliver’s
father; “and I thank you for the accommodation,”
he added politely. “Here are the papers.”</p>

<p>The document in the matter was duly drawn up
and signed. Then Dr. Tangus took his leave.</p>

<p>“I trust you are able to meet the claim when due,”
said he on departing.</p>

<p>“I shall try my best,” responded Mr. Bright.</p>

<p>When the door was closed he sank down in his chair.</p>

<p>“We have two months’ grace, Oliver. If I cannot
pay at the end of that time, out we go.”</p>

<p>“Two months is quite a while,” replied the boy as
bravely as he could. “A good deal may happen in
that time. Any way, it will give us both a chance
to look around for situations. But tell me, isn’t this
place worth more than the mortgage he holds?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but it wouldn’t bring it at a forced sale. I
am quite sure we will be left without anything but
our personal effects. Of course they amount to considerable;
but oh, how I hate to part with any of
them!”</p>

<p>“I hope it won’t become necessary, father. But
will you let me see those letters that Colonel Mendix
wrote you? I have an idea he didn’t tell you the
truth about that mine.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bright started.</p>

<p>“The same thought has occurred to me,” he said.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
“I often wished I had gone to the place and seen for
myself.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“I was ill, and too much interested in bonds here.
The bonds that I carried were of the par value of one
hundred thousand dollars, four times what the mine
cost. I gave my attention to the larger deal. Besides,
there was another reason; I did not know exactly
where the mine was located nor how to reach it.”</p>

<p>“You did not?”</p>

<p>“No. Mendix had all the papers; and he kept
them, or destroyed them, I do not know which.”</p>

<p>“Then for all you know the mine may be valuable
and in running order to-day,” went on Oliver excitedly.</p>

<p>“I doubt it, Oliver; and yet”—</p>

<p>“If Mendix was a rascal, his saying that the mine
was flooded might only be a ruse to get you to abandon
your claim to it.”</p>

<p>“That is so. To tell the truth, more than once,
since I lost my other property, I have thought of
going out and making an examination.”</p>

<p>“Then why don’t you go? It will do no harm, and
may save you from ruin.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bright started up.</p>

<p>“I will go, Oliver,” he cried.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br />
<small>AN ACCIDENT.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>His sudden resolve seemed to liven up Mr. Bright
considerably. He rubbed his hands and strode up
and down the room.</p>

<p>“Yes; I will go,” he repeated. “As you say, it
can do no harm, and may save us from ruin.”</p>

<p>“May I go too?” asked Oliver eagerly.</p>

<p>Mr. Bright thought in silence for a moment.</p>

<p>“I would like to have you with me,” he said;
“but I think you had better remain behind. One
of us ought to stay here, and, besides, the expense
of the journey will be considerable.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” said the boy; “I would like to go
first-rate.”</p>

<p>“Come, we will go over what letters and papers
I have together. Perhaps you will see something in
them that I have overlooked,” said Mr. Bright.</p>

<p>Opening one of the locked drawers of the desk,
Mr. Bright brought forth the various communications
he had received from Colonel Mendix and James
Barr. Both father and son read them over carefully.</p>

<p>“It is my impression that this Mendix did not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
wish you to visit the Aurora mine,” said Oliver.
“If you will notice, throughout the letters he speaks
of the hard road to travel to get there, and the unhealthiness
of the climate, and all that. He knew
you were not strong, and he hoped that would deter
you from venturing.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right, Oliver. I did not think
of that before.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure this Mendix has gone to South
America?”</p>

<p>“I was; but your questions fill me with doubt. I
begin to think that perhaps I have been blind all
this time. I think—my! my! What is the matter
with Jerry?”</p>

<p>Oliver’s gaze followed that of his father out of the
window. There, on the smooth lawn, a spirited horse
was acting in an exceedingly strange manner, throwing
his head viciously from side to side.</p>

<p>“Donald has been whipping him again,” said Oliver.
“He ought to know better.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bright did not reply. Springing from his chair,
he hurried from the library, his son following.</p>

<p>In his day Mr. Bright had been quite a horseman,
and Oliver, too, liked to ride. Both hated to see an
animal abused, and both were excited over the present
sight.</p>

<p>“Whoa! Jerry! whoa!” cried Mr. Bright, running
up to the horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>He caught the animal by the halter, which had
been broken off rather short, and attempted to soothe
him. But Jerry’s blood was up, and before Mr.
Bright was aware he was thrown in the air and
came down heavily against the grape arbor.</p>

<p>“Oh!” He gave a deep groan of pain. “Catch
him, Oliver; but be careful about it.”</p>

<p>The boy was already advancing. He caught the
halter, and then vaulted upon Jerry’s back.</p>

<p>For a moment there was a fierce struggle, but
Oliver kept his seat, and feeling himself mastered,
the horse subsided. Then the boy jumped to the
ground and turned him over to the man of all work.</p>

<p>“Take him back to the stable, Donald,” he said;
“and mind you, he is to be whipped no more.”</p>

<p>“I only struck him once”—began the man.</p>

<p>“That was once too often. Jerry is too nervous
to be handled in that manner.”</p>

<p>Oliver saw the horse led away, and then turned
his attention to his father. To his surprise Mr.
Bright had fainted.</p>

<p>Running to the well, the boy procured some cold
water, which he sprinkled in his father’s face. It
had the effect of reviving him almost immediately.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt?” asked Oliver in deep anxiety.</p>

<p>“I—I am afraid I am. My chest hurts, and I
cannot use my right leg.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll call Dr. Kitchell,” replied Oliver.</p>

<p>Fortunately the physician lived directly across the
road. He was at home, and in less than three minutes
the boy had him over.</p>

<p>“Humph! two ribs broken, and also the right
leg!” said Dr. Kitchell. “Rather a serious accident.
Come, we will carry him into the house.”</p>

<p>Donald was called, and the three succeeded in
carrying the unfortunate man into the house and
placing him on the lounge in the sitting-room.</p>

<p>Then the man of all work was dispatched to the
drug-store, and the doctor went to work to set the
broken limb and fix up the fractured ribs. Oliver
assisted all he could, the tears standing in his eyes
meanwhile.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Dr. Kitchell, noticing his grief.
“It will be all right. All your father wants is
quietness for a couple of months. There is small
danger.”</p>

<p>Oliver felt relieved at this statement. And yet he
could not help but think of the trip to California.
His father would have to abandon that now, and he
would hardly be well before they would be obliged
to leave the house and seek a home elsewhere.</p>

<p>Towards evening Mr. Bright felt somewhat easier,
and he and Oliver had quite a talk. He demurred
strongly at being compelled to rest quietly for eight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
weeks or longer, and spoke of the plans that must
now be cast aside.</p>

<p>“Why not let me go?” said Oliver suddenly. “I
am sure I can get along all right.”</p>

<p>“No, Oliver; it would be asking too much of
you.”</p>

<p>“No, it would not. Can you get along without
me?”</p>

<p>“I suppose I might; Mrs. Hanson is a capital
nurse. But it is too big an undertaking for a boy.”</p>

<p>“You forget, father, that I am nearly seventeen
years old.”</p>

<p>“No, I do not; nor do I forget that you are smart
for your age. But still I would hate to send you
on a journey that might prove full of danger. If
their accounts be true, the road is a perilous one,
and the mining districts are full of rough characters.”</p>

<p>“After I left San Francisco I could go well armed.
I don’t think it would be so dangerous. A good
class of settlers are pouring into the place, and they
would surely not molest me. You must remember
that things are not as they were at the close of the
war.”</p>

<p>“What you say is true, Oliver; but I would hate
to send you into the midst of danger, however slight.
If you were only going to San Francisco it would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
be different. But to go away up in the mountains,
and utterly alone”—</p>

<p>Mr. Bright did not finish, a violent twitch of pain
stopping him short. Seeing that his father could not
stand conversing, Oliver withdrew.</p>

<p>He ascended to his own room, and, taking a chair
by the window, sat down to think. For fully half
an hour he did not move. Then he went below and
made his way to the kitchen, where Mrs. Hanson
was preparing some broth for the sick man.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Hanson,” he said, calling her aside, “father
was planning to go on a journey, and now that he
can’t go, I’ve been thinking of going for him without
letting him know—that is, for several days. Do
you think you could get along without me while I
am gone?”</p>

<p>“Why, bless you, Oliver, yes! I’ve been a nurse
these ten years before I was a housekeeper. It will
be no trouble whatever.”</p>

<p>“And you will not let him know that I have
gone—that is, for a few days? It might only
worry him.”</p>

<p>“If you wish it.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s settled.”</p>

<p>“When will you go?”</p>

<p>“Monday morning early.”</p>

<p>“Very well; I won’t say a word. It’s business, I
suppose?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>“Yes; father’s business; something that must be
attended to.”</p>

<p>All that evening Oliver was busy with his preparations.
There was a big valise to pack, and numerous
other things to do. At ten o’clock, when the
others had retired, he stole down to the library, and
seating himself at the table, took complete copies of
all the letters and papers relating to the Aurora
mine and Colonel Mendix’s peculiar method of transacting
business.</p>

<p>“Now I am ready to start,” he said to himself,
as he arose. “When I arrive in New York I will
either sell or pawn my gold watch and my diamond
pin, and then—ho, for the Aurora mine!”</p>

<small>LEAVING HOME.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>On the following morning Oliver found his father
somewhat recovered from the rude shock he had received.
Of course the man was unable to move from
the couch upon which he rested, but he was able to
sit up and converse without, apparently, more than
an occasional dull pain.</p>

<p>Mr. Bright was, however, much worried over the
disarrangement of his plans, sighing out continually
his disappointment at not being able to leave on a
tour of discovery. To all this Oliver made no reply,
saving to urge his parent not to worry, as all would
yet turn out right.</p>

<p>During the day, the boy managed, by skillful questioning,
to gain all the additional information that
was to be had. In the afternoon he attended Sunday-school,
the last time, he thought, for many weeks
and perhaps months to come.</p>

<p>In the class with Oliver was Gus Gregory, his chum,
a short and exceedingly stout youth, with a freckled
but not unpleasant face. At the close of the service
he and Oliver left together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>“Well, how did you make out over our fun at
the doctor’s?” was Gus’s first question.</p>

<p>Oliver told him.</p>

<p>“My, but you got off easier than I did!” exclaimed
the stout youth. “Didn’t pop give it to me though!
I haven’t been able to sit down with any kind of
comfort since.”</p>

<p>Oliver did not reply. He was silent for a moment,
and then laid his hand on his chum’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Say, Gus,” he said, “will you keep a secret if
I tell it to you?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course, Olly,” was the prompt reply.
“Did I ever let out anything I shouldn’t?”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I’m going away.”</p>

<p>“Going away? Where?”</p>

<p>“To California.”</p>

<p>“Phew! you don’t mean it!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do. I’m going to start to-morrow morning
first thing. I thought I’d tell you and say good-by.”</p>

<p>“Does your father know?”</p>

<p>“No. Only Mrs. Hanson, and now you.”</p>

<p>“What are you going for? just to run away?
I thought you said your father didn’t touch you for
the trouble we got into.”</p>

<p>“Neither did he. I’m going on business. Come,
let us sit under that tree, and I’ll tell you all about
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>And seated under a stately elm that grew by the
roadside, Oliver related all there was in his mind.</p>

<p>Gus Gregory was deeply interested.</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll succeed,” he said. “My, how I wish
I was going along! Nothing would suit me better.”</p>

<p>“And nothing would suit me better than to have
you,” replied Oliver; “but that can’t be thought of.”</p>

<p>“Which way are you going?”</p>

<p>“By the way of Panama.”</p>

<p>“It will cost quite a bit.”</p>

<p>“Something less than a hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“That is quite a sum, but not so much as I
thought. Have you got your ticket yet?”</p>

<p>“No; I intend to get that in New York to-morrow.
The steamer sails for Aspinwall on Wednesday.”</p>

<p>The two boys talked the matter over for some
time. Gus was intensely interested.</p>

<p>“Well, I hope you’ll meet with success,” he said
on parting. “I think it is a big undertaking for
a boy, but I wish it was I instead of you.”</p>

<p>The remainder of the Sunday passed quickly. In
the evening Oliver spent another pleasant hour with
his father.</p>

<p>When the time came for parting, the boy could
hardly keep back the tears. Who knew how long
it would be before he should see his father again? He
was almost tempted to tell all, but the fear of being
told to give up the project kept back the words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>Oliver slept but little that night, and he was up
at early dawn. Making a hasty toilet, he took up
his valise and stole down-stairs. Mrs. Hanson had
anticipated him, and a warm breakfast stood ready
to which he did but scant justice.</p>

<p>Half an hour later he was off, the housekeeper
wishing him Godspeed. The railroad station was
half a mile distant; but it took the boy scarcely any
time to cover that distance, so fearful was he of being
discovered and told to return.</p>

<p>Rockvale was a town of considerable size, situated
some forty miles from the metropolis. There were
over a dozen trains daily to Jersey City, the first at
half-past six in the morning. This was the one Oliver
had calculated on taking, and buying a ticket, he
waited a few moments, and then, as the train came
rolling in, got aboard.</p>

<p>There was a sudden jerk, and the train started and
rolled out away from the station. Oliver Bright was
off on his strange quest at last.</p>

<p>He felt queer as he settled back in his seat which
he occupied alone. What would the outcome of his
trip be? Would he succeed or fail?</p>

<p>The run to Jersey City was an uneventful one.
Oliver had taken it a great number of times, so it was
no novelty, and he occupied the time in studying
a guide-book he had purchased at the news-stand.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
When they arrived at the ferry he followed the stream
of people on to the boat, and off again at the other
side.</p>

<p>“New York!” he thought to himself as he passed
up Liberty Street. “Now to sell or pawn the watch
and the pin, and then I will go to the steamship
ticket-office and engage a berth.”</p>

<p>Before leaving home, the boy had cut from the metropolitan
paper Mr. Bright was in the habit of taking
the names and addresses of several pawnbrokers, and
toward one of these Oliver now bent his steps.</p>

<p>He much preferred pawning the articles to selling
them, as both the watch and the diamond scarf-pin
were gifts from his father, and he wanted the chance
to recover them.</p>

<p>Entering the establishment, he drew out the gold
watch, and passing it over to the clerk, asked how
much would be allowed upon it.</p>

<p>“Your own?” was the first question.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; a birthday gift.”</p>

<p>The clerk sent the watch to the back part of the
store for examination.</p>

<p>“Fifty dollars,” he said upon his return.</p>

<p>“Fifty dollars!” exclaimed Oliver, in some dismay.
“I thought I could get more! The watch cost over
a hundred.”</p>

<p>“That is all we can allow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>“I cannot let it go for that;” and Oliver slipped
the timepiece in his pocket.</p>

<p>The clerk paid another visit to the office.</p>

<p>“We will make that sixty dollars,” he said, coming
back. “You will not get more anywhere.”</p>

<p>“I shall try,” replied Oliver.</p>

<p>Another establishment was close at hand. But here
the proprietor would not go above fifty dollars; so
Oliver went back to the first place.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll take that sixty dollars,” he said.</p>

<p>“Told you you couldn’t get any more,” returned
the clerk coolly, as he made out the ticket and handed
over the money.</p>

<p>“And now how much will you allow me for this
pin?” asked Oliver, as he drew it from his wallet.
“It is a pure diamond.”</p>

<p>“Is this also a gift?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>The clerk took it back to the private office. When
he returned he told Oliver to go back, as the proprietor
would like to see him.</p>

<p>Oliver did so, and found himself face to face with a
thin, sharp nosed individual.</p>

<p>“Where did you get that pin?” was the man’s
question.</p>

<p>“My father gave it to me on Christmas, two years
ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>“Rather a fine Christmas gift.”</p>

<p>“It was, sir.”</p>

<p>“What is your name and address, please?” And
the man prepared to write it down.</p>

<p>Oliver told him.</p>

<p>“And you are sure your father gave you this pin
for Christmas?”</p>

<p>“Certainly I am,” replied the boy, flushing. “I
hope you don’t think I—”</p>

<p>“I have nothing to say, excepting that a gold watch
and a diamond pin were stolen from a boarding-house
in Twenty-fourth Street last evening.”</p>

<p>“And you think—” began Oliver, his heart rising
in his throat.</p>

<p>“Never mind what I think, young man. Of course
you may be innocent. But we must always be on our
guard. I have sent my clerk around to the police
precinct close by. You will please remain here until
he returns.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<small>AT THE STEAMSHIP OFFICE.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Oliver was astonished and dismayed by the pawnbroker’s
statement. What if the police should think
he was the thief? It would cause him no end of
trouble, and might prove the means of compelling
him to return home.</p>

<p>“I don’t see what reasons you have for supposing
the things are not mine,” he began.</p>

<p>“I do not say they are not,” was the reply. “In
fact, I must say you look thoroughly honest. But,
as I said before, we must be careful. We cannot
afford to take in things that have been stolen and
then give them up to the police.”</p>

<p>Oliver sank down in a chair. He had but a
short ten minutes to wait, but the time seemed an
eternity.</p>

<p>He was glad to see the clerk return alone.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” were his words. “The goods taken
were recovered an hour ago.”</p>

<p>How relieved Oliver felt! He sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“Please give me the pin,” he said.</p>

<p>The man handed it over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>“I am sorry I suspected you,” he said. “But
business is business.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it is.”</p>

<p>“I thought you wanted to pawn that pin?”</p>

<p>“So I do; but I shall take it elsewhere now.”</p>

<p>And without waiting to be questioned further,
Oliver hurried from the place.</p>

<p>About a block down the street he came to a similar
establishment—indeed, the neighborhood was full
of them. The proprietor took the pin and examined
it closely.</p>

<p>“What did you give for this pin?” he asked
cautiously.</p>

<p>“I did not buy it. My father gave it to me.”</p>

<p>“How much do you want on it?”</p>

<p>Oliver hesitated. He knew he had better place the
figure high.</p>

<p>“Seventy-five dollars.”</p>

<p>“The pin did not cost that.”</p>

<p>“It cost more than that.”</p>

<p>“I will let you have forty dollars on it.”</p>

<p>“I must have at least sixty.”</p>

<p>Finally a compromise was effected, and Oliver received
his ticket and fifty dollars.</p>

<p>“That makes one hundred and ten dollars for the
two,” he said to himself when on the street once
more; “and that, added to what I have saved up from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
my spending money, gives me a capital of one hundred
and eighty-five dollars. By hook or by crook
that amount must see me through.”</p>

<p>From the pawnbroker’s Oliver made his way to
lower Broadway, where the steamship office was located.
It was a busy place, and the boy was compelled
to wait for his turn.</p>

<p>While he stood in line he meditated on what he
would have to pay for a ticket. If there was any
such thing as going second or third class he intended
to do so. In his present straitened circumstances
every dollar counted.</p>

<p>Suddenly a young man behind him touched him
on the elbow and said,—</p>

<p>“Say, do you know if they take back tickets
here?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Oliver.</p>

<p>“I mean tickets to California. I have a ticket for
Wednesday’s steamer and I can’t go because my
uncle has just died, and I must take charge of part
of his business.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Oliver. “I am just here to
buy a ticket for myself,” he continued.</p>

<p>“Is that so? Then let me sell you mine. I paid
eighty dollars for it, and I’ll let you have it for
sixty; that is, if they won’t take it back.”</p>

<p>“Is that the cheapest passage?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>“It is on the regular lines.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll take it, if they won’t take it back.”</p>

<p>At the desk it was found that the ticket could
be exchanged for a later boat, but could not be canceled.
As the young man did not know whether,
under the present condition of things, he would go
to California or not, he decided to sell the ticket
to Oliver; and the transfer was made on the spot.</p>

<p>Oliver was told that the boat would leave at ten
o’clock Wednesday morning from the pier on the
North River. He made a note of the time and the
number of the pier, and then quitted the place.</p>

<p>As he did so, he ran plump into a man who was
hurrying up the steps.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon!” he exclaimed. “I did not
mean”—</p>

<p>And then he stopped short. And small wonder.
The man he had encountered was Colonel Mendix!</p>

<p>In all his life Oliver was never more astonished.
He knew not what to say or do.</p>

<p>Colonel Mendix, having seen him but once, and
that many years previous, did not recognize the boy.
He stepped back, then passed Oliver, and entered
the steamship office.</p>

<p>“Has the Rosabel sailed yet?” Oliver heard him
ask.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; half an hour ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>“Ha, too bad! And the next steamer?”</p>

<p>“Sails Wednesday.”</p>

<p>“Was there a passenger on the Rosabel named
Whyland—Thomas Whyland?” continued the colonel
anxiously.</p>

<p>The clerk looked over the register.</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“You are sure?”</p>

<p>“His name is not here. If he was aboard he must
have sailed on some one else’s ticket.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I see. Thank you.”</p>

<p>Colonel Mendix turned and left the building. Almost
mechanically Oliver followed him.</p>

<p>He knew not what to make of the unexpected
meeting. Had Mendix just returned from South
America or had he never been to that country?</p>

<p>“I must find out,” thought the boy. “Perhaps
if I discover his business here I may be able to
find out something about the Aurora mine also. I
wish I had caught the name of the man he asked
for.”</p>

<p>He had the day before him, and also Tuesday, and
he resolved to make good use of the time. Who
knew but what he might be able to gain a deal of
information before starting for the West?</p>

<p>Colonel Mendix walked rapidly up Broadway until
he reached Trinity Church. Then he crossed over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
and hurried down Wall Street. Oliver was close
behind and saw him enter an office not far away.</p>

<p>Walking past the place, he read the sign,—</p>

<p class="noic">EZRA DODGE &amp; CO.,<br />
<span class="smcap">California Mining Stocks</span>,</p>

<p class="noi">over the door. He would have liked to follow Colonel
Mendix inside, but could find no pretext for so
doing until he noticed a slip on the window which
read,—</p>

<p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Free Circulars Inside.</span></p>

<p>Entering the place, he saw that the colonel had
taken a seat within the office railing and was in
earnest conversation with an elderly gentleman, presumably
Mr. Dodge.</p>

<p>Oliver stepped up to a clerk in charge.</p>

<p>“Will you kindly give me a circular of stocks?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” was the reply. “Think of investing?”</p>

<p>“I wish to see what you have.”</p>

<p>“Offer you some fine inducements,” said the clerk,
handing over a folded paper.</p>

<p>Oliver opened the circular, and pretended to look
it over.</p>

<p>“Now, Dodge, about this Aurora mine,” he heard
Colonel Mendix say, and immediately he was all attention.</p>

<small>A CONVERSATION OF IMPORTANCE.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Oliver Bright was sure that he was going to
hear something of importance, and he determined
that not a word of the conversation between Colonel
Mendix and Ezra Dodge should escape him. With
his eyes fixed upon the circular in his hand, he kept
his ears wide open for whatever might be said.</p>

<p>“Yes, about the Aurora mine,” rejoined Ezra
Dodge. “I want to know if you have a clear title
to it?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course—that is, I and another have.”</p>

<p>“Then that’s all right. I wanted to know what
I was loaning money on.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I give enough other security?” asked the
colonel, with a slight sneer in his tones.</p>

<p>“Certainly. If you hadn’t I wouldn’t have loaned
you a dollar. Why, I don’t even know where your
mine is located, excepting that it is somewhere on
the Mokelumne River.”</p>

<p>“Well, whether you know it or not, the mine is
there, and that is enough for me.”</p>

<p>“Does it pay?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps it does.”</p>

<p>“Are you working it?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I am.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw! if you don’t want to say anything
about it, tell me so,” cried Ezra Dodge, in evident
disgust.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t. What I want to know is, where
can that machinery be bought?”</p>

<p>“Right in San Francisco.”</p>

<p>“You are sure?”</p>

<p>“Positive. If you don’t care to believe me, buy
it in New York and have it shipped out.”</p>

<p>“Come, Dodge, don’t get mad. If I want to keep
the location of my mine to myself, it ought to be all
right. I intend”—</p>

<p>Oliver did not hear any more of the conversation.
The clerk in the establishment approached him, and
talked stocks so persistently that the boy was glad
to escape from the office.</p>

<p>He had, however, overheard several important facts.
The mine was located on the Mokelumne River; Mendix
did not care to speak of its value, but was
evidently investing considerable money in buying
machinery, which would tend to show that the claim
was worth a good deal.</p>

<p>“How fortunate that I met the man!” thought
Oliver. “I wouldn’t have missed this chance for a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
hundred dollars! And to tell father that he was in
South America while he has been in California all
the while! On the Mokelumne River. That ought
not to be so hard to locate.”</p>

<p>Oliver did not stop to consider that the spot mentioned
was many miles in extent, and in a very wild
and mountainous region. His mind was filled only
with the desire to reach the place, and view with his
own eyes his father’s property.</p>

<p>Walking to the opposite side of the street, he stood
in the shadow of a doorway and waited for Colonel
Mendix to appear. Five minutes passed, and then
the man came from Ezra Dodge’s office, walked up
Wall Street, and turned down into Broad.</p>

<p>Oliver followed him as best he could, but suddenly
Mendix turned another corner, and before the boy
could reach the spot the man had disappeared.</p>

<p>In vain Oliver hunted up and down and in the
several side streets; Colonel Mendix was nowhere to
be seen, and after half an hour’s search Oliver gave
up the task.</p>

<p>It was now half-past twelve, and walking about had
made Oliver hungry. He moved along until he
came to a restaurant, and entering, ordered dinner.</p>

<p>While at the table he was astonished at the bustle
and confusion around him. It was true he had
been to the metropolis many times, but on every succeeding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
occasion the city seemed to be more busy,
more full of life.</p>

<p>Having eaten his meal, and settled the amount of
the check at the desk, Oliver sauntered out upon
the street once more. He had a day and a half
before him, and hardly knew what to do. He walked
up Nassau Street to Park Row, and then turning,
drifted with the tide of humanity down Broadway.
The knowledge that he was carrying so much cash
about worried him, but each time he felt for it he
found that his money was still safe in the inside
pocket of his vest.</p>

<p>At length Oliver reached the Battery, and sat
down on one of the benches that line the promenades.
His long walk in the afternoon sun had tired
him, and his head was beginning to ache.</p>

<p>The sights around him interested him not a little.
Directly opposite to him was a poor women with a
sick baby, the little thing fairly gasping for breath.
To his right sat a shabby workman, or he might have
been a tramp, half asleep, and beside him a tall,
gaunt, almost starved looking boy, certainly not much
older than himself.</p>

<p>Upon another bench three emigrant Germans were
holding an animated conversation in their own
tongue, though Oliver occasionally heard the names
Chicago and Milwaukee mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<p>The sick baby interested the boy most of all. His
heart ached to see the little one in such misery, and
when he saw the mother wipe the tears from her
eyes, he hastily rose and walked over to her.</p>

<p>“You seem in distress,” he said kindly. “Can I
do anything for you?”</p>

<p>She looked up into his honest, open face.</p>

<p>“My baby is so sick!” she cried. “I would not
care if it was myself—but baby”—and she broke
down completely.</p>

<p>“You ought to go to a doctor,” he went on.</p>

<p>“Alas! I have no money!” she replied. “I spent
the last fifty cents I had yesterday.”</p>

<p>Oliver’s hand went down into his pocket on the
instant. He could ill spare the money, but he would
have done anything rather than refuse the woman
assistance.</p>

<p>“Here is a dollar for you,” he said, holding out
that amount. “I wish I could make it more; but
that will help you some.”</p>

<p>For an instant the woman stared at him. Then
she snatched the silver coin from his hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, thank you!” she cried; “I did
not expect it. You are too kind.”</p>

<p>“I would advise you to get medicine for the baby
at once.”</p>

<p>“I will, sir; I know something that I think will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
just cure my poor Ellie. Oh, thank you, sir, and
God bless you!”</p>

<p>And with tears of joy streaming down her face
the woman hurried away.</p>

<p>A warm feeling surged through Oliver’s heart as
he slowly followed, the feeling that always comes
when one has done a noble action.</p>

<p>“Poor woman, poor baby,” he murmured to himself.
“I hope she gets the medicine and that it
cures her Ellie. What a dear baby it was!”</p>

<p>He had hardly gone a dozen steps before he felt
a hand upon his shoulder. It was the gaunt-looking
boy.</p>

<p>“Will you please help me a little?” he asked
pleadingly. “I have been out of work for three
weeks and can’t get anything to do anywhere.”</p>

<p>“You are telling the truth?” asked Oliver sharply,
to make sure that he was not being deceived.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I worked in Haddan’s piano action
factory that burnt down.”</p>

<p>“And you cannot get work anywhere?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. Oh, you don’t know how hard I have
tried! Every morning I answer the advertisements
in the papers, but there are always a hundred men
for one place.”</p>

<p>By the way the boy spoke Oliver knew that he
told the truth. He hesitated for a moment, and then
handed out another dollar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>“There,” he said. “I cannot afford that very well,
but I hate to see any one in want. I hope by the
time that is gone you will find work. Are you alone
in the world?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then, if you cannot get work here, I advise you
to strike out for some other place.”</p>

<p>“Thank you; I won’t stay in New York much
longer.”</p>

<p>Oliver did not reply, and the two separated.</p>

<p>“Cannot find work anywhere,” mused the boy;
“it must be hard indeed. What will father and
I do if the Aurora mine scheme proves a failure? I
would be nearly as badly off as that poor chap. God
grant it does not come to that!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<small>A NIGHT IN NEW YORK.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>From the Battery, Oliver made his way back to
Wall Street. He was in hopes of seeing Colonel
Mendix again, and for this reason passed and repassed
Ezra Dodge’s office several times.</p>

<p>But his watching was fruitless, and finally by five
o’clock he gave up. By this time the financial center
was almost deserted, and he saw Ezra Dodge’s clerk
close the office up for the day, and walk away.</p>

<p>Instantly he decided to follow and accost the
young man, and this he did before he had formed
any clear plan of action.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” he said; “but I think I saw you
down in Mr. Dodge’s office.”</p>

<p>“You did,” replied the clerk wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t Colonel Mendix there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he was; this morning.”</p>

<p>“Can you tell me where he is stopping?”</p>

<p>“At the Gilliford House.”</p>

<p>“The Gilliford House?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It is on Broadway near Sixth Avenue. Did
you want to see him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>“I did. Do you suppose he is there now?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. He intends to start for California
soon.”</p>

<p>“So I understand. He has a mine there, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” The clerk hesitated. “I don’t know much
about Colonel Mendix,” he continued.</p>

<p>“Does he live here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; he comes from Sacramento City.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. And you think he is up at the
Gilliford House?”</p>

<p>“He is if he hasn’t left for the West yet.”</p>

<p>“Did he speak of leaving so soon?”</p>

<p>“I heard him tell Mr. Dodge he might take the
train for St. Louis to-day.”</p>

<p>The clerk nodded and then boarded a Broadway
car. Oliver stood on the pavement in wonder.</p>

<p>“Might take the train for St. Louis to-day!” he
murmured; “and I thought all the while that he
intended to stay in New York for some time at least!
If he has gone he will have a full day’s start of me,
to say nothing of the difference in the trip overland
and the one by the way of the isthmus. I wish I
was going by train instead.”</p>

<p>After a moment’s reflection, he resolved to go at
once to the Gilliford House and see if the colonel
had yet departed. If he had, then there was nothing
to do but wait for the steamer on Wednesday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>On the corner was a policeman, and the officer
quickly directed the boy to the proper elevated road
by which he could reach the hotel mentioned. Oliver
climbed the steps, procured his ticket, dropped it into
the box, and a moment later was aboard the train.</p>

<p>Though he had been to New York a number of
times, the ride in the air as it were was somewhat
of a novelty to him. He sat in one of the little
cross seats in the middle of the car, and thoroughly
enjoyed the panorama that swept by—a panorama
that was so close to him that he could note every
detail.</p>

<p>At length Thirty-third Street was reached. Here
Oliver left the train, went down the long stairs, and
inquired his way to the Gilliford House.</p>

<p>It was not a long distance off, and in five minutes
more he had entered the office.</p>

<p>“Is Colonel Mendix stopping here?” he asked of
the clerk at the desk.</p>

<p>The young man looked at the register.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Wish to see him?”</p>

<p>Oliver hesitated for a moment.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“I will send up your card.”</p>

<p>“I—I— He would not know me,” stammered
Oliver. “Cannot you say that a young man wishes
to see him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p>“Certainly. Just wait a moment. I’ll send right
up.”</p>

<p>Oliver took a seat and waited. The bell-boy was
gone probably five minutes.</p>

<p>“Colonel Mendix is out,” were the clerk’s words
upon his return.</p>

<p>“Have you any idea when he will be back?” asked
Oliver, somewhat disappointed, and yet relieved to
think he would not have to face the man just then,
when he was hardly prepared.</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>Oliver stood for a moment in thought. He would
have to remain in New York over that night and
the next. Why not stay where he was?</p>

<p>“Can I engage a room here for to-morrow night
and to-night?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Certainly. What kind of a room do you desire?”</p>

<p>“Not too high priced.”</p>

<p>“European or American plan?” was the clerk’s
question, meaning thereby, as many of my readers
know, if he wished it without or including meals.</p>

<p>“European.”</p>

<p>“From one to three dollars.”</p>

<p>“I will take the dollar room, sir.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Pay in advance.”</p>

<p>“I will pay for to-night. If I stay to-morrow I
will pay that in the morning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p>Oliver paid the money. He did not wish to arrange
for meals at the hotel, for he did not know
where he would be during the following day.</p>

<p>“John, show this gentleman to room 234.”</p>

<p>“And if Colonel Mendix comes in, will you let
me know?”</p>

<p>“I will if I see him.”</p>

<p>Taking Oliver’s valise, the porter led the way to
the elevator, and they were raised to the fifth floor.
Number 234 proved to be a cozy room at the rear
of the hall. It was well furnished, with all conveniences,
even to the pens and ink that stood on
a side table.</p>

<p>Throwing off his coat, vest, and hat, the boy took
a good wash in the marble bowl and combed his
hair. This refreshed him and made his head feel
better. Then locking up the room so that his baggage
would be safe, he went below to a neighboring
restaurant, and procured a light supper.</p>

<p>The sight of the pens and ink in his room made
him think of writing a letter to his father, and he
spent the best part of the evening doing so. He
told of all that had happened, and begged his father
not to be angry at his having taken the matter in
hand.</p>

<p>The letter finished, Oliver went out and posted
it. Upon returning he asked about Colonel Mendix,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
and was told the gentleman had not yet come
back.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock Oliver retired. He was quite worn
out, but the strangeness of his situation caused him
to sleep but little. At seven o’clock he was dressed
and at the desk.</p>

<p>“Colonel Mendix has sent word that his baggage
be taken to the depot,” said the clerk. “He took
the train last night for the West.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br />
<small>ON THE STEAMER.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Oliver Bright was so taken aback by the announcement
that Colonel Mendix had left New York
that he hardly knew what to do. Since the day before
he had calculated upon having a talk with the
Spanish gentleman, and hoped to gain some important
knowledge without revealing his own identity.</p>

<p>But now that chance was lost. The colonel had
gone, and it was not likely that the two would meet
this side of San Francisco.</p>

<p>“Took the train last night?” he repeated slowly.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied the clerk. “Did you wish to see
him very much?”</p>

<p>“I did indeed. What time did the train start?”</p>

<p>“At nine fifteen.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>Oliver left the desk, and walked slowly from the
hotel. He was in no humor for eating his breakfast,
and strolled up Broadway for a considerable distance,
and up and down a number of the side streets.</p>

<p>“He will reach the West long before I do,” he reflected.
“Perhaps before I get to San Francisco he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
will be at the mines. Still, he may stop over to buy
that machinery he spoke of. Heigh-ho! it’s a chance
lost anyway.”</p>

<p>Oliver was not naturally of a desponding disposition,
and in an hour his spirits had brightened, and he was
once more himself. He walked into a modest looking
restaurant and procured a light breakfast, and then,
in lieu of something more important to do, started out
to see the sights.</p>

<p>The morning passed quickly enough. At noon
Oliver found himself far over by the East River. He
walked down the Bowery until he came to the Brooklyn
Bridge, and taking a walk over this magnificent
structure, procured his dinner in Brooklyn. By the
time it was finished, and he had recrossed the bridge,
it was nearly three o’clock.</p>

<p>“I’ll wait until six, and then see if there are any
letters for me,” he said to himself, as he passed the
post-office building. “Father may write to me at once,
or get some one to write for him.”</p>

<p>For a long time Oliver stood on Park Row, watching
the newsboys folding their papers and disposing of
them. One little mite of a chap, who was certainly
not over five years of age, interested him greatly.</p>

<p>The boy was so small he could hardly carry his
bundle of papers, and yet he seemed to drive a brisk
trade, often selling a paper where some one larger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
than he had met with a rebuff. Crimpsey, he heard
some of the other boys call him; and finally Oliver
patronized him to the extent of buying an afternoon
paper for a cent.</p>

<p>“How’s trade?” he said, as he waited for his
change.</p>

<p>“Nuthin’ extra,” was the little chap’s reply.
“There ain’t no extra news in ter day.” And away
he went shouting, “Extra! Last ’dition!”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t want to be a newsboy,” thought Oliver;
“yet I would rather do that than starve.”</p>

<p>Walking over to the little park in front of the City
Hall, he sat down on one of the benches and read the
paper he had bought. There was but little in it to
interest him, and he had soon finished. Then he
threw down the sheet. In an instant a man sitting
near snatched it up.</p>

<p>“Through?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Oliver.</p>

<p>“Thanks;” and immediately the man was deeply
absorbed in the journal.</p>

<p>“Evidently he is too poor to buy a paper, and yet
he is hungry for something to read,” thought Oliver,
and he hit it exactly.</p>

<p>The boy found the time hanging heavily upon his
hands after this. He detested spending a day in idleness,
yet it could not be helped. He walked over to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
the North River, and then up West Street, and finally
returned up Vesey Street to the post-office.</p>

<p>Here he hunted up the right window, and asked
if there were any letters.</p>

<p>For reply one was handed out.</p>

<p>How eagerly Oliver took it up! It bore the Rockvale
postmark. It was from home!</p>

<p>Stepping over to one of the windows, he tore the
epistle open. It was from his father, and ran as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Oliver</span>,—As you supposed, I was greatly astonished
to find that you had left home to go to California to hunt
up the Aurora mine. I was inclined to think that it was a foolhardy
undertaking; but upon reflection I will only say, now you
have started, take care of yourself, and don’t run into unnecessary
danger.</p>

<p>I have not time to write all I desire, as I am afraid you will
not receive the letter if I do not put it in the morning mail.</p>

<p>You say you have enough money for the present. When you
reach San Francisco there will be a letter with a money order or
express order for you.</p>

<p>I can understand what a surprise it was to meet Colonel
Mendix. Have you seen him again? Be sure and keep out of
trouble. I have no doubt but that he was deceiving me all the
time, and cannot forgive myself for having trusted him as I did.</p>

<p>I suppose you did not return home Tuesday because you
thought I might detain you. Well, Oliver, perhaps I might
have done so, but as it is, you may go, and God be with you.</p>

<p>I am feeling as well as can be expected. Dr. Kitchell says
I must keep quiet and all will be well. It is hard to do so, but I
will try to be content.</p>

<p>Let me hear from you as often as possible, and do not hesitate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
to return at any time, no matter whether you accomplish
anything or not. Although if you fail it will be a bitter blow,
we will manage somehow to get along.</p>

<p>Now I must close. With all my love I remain, your father,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Arthur Bright</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>Oliver had quite some trouble in deciphering the
letter, which had been written in great haste. It is
needless to say its contents pleased him greatly. A
heavy load was lifted from his heart, for he had
dreaded the thought of being recalled, and giving up
the quest.</p>

<p>“I must not fail,” he murmured to himself, as
he put the letter in his pocket. “Father expects
me to succeed, even if he doesn’t say so. I am sure
if I do not he will never get over the blow.”</p>

<p>There was some truth in this, though not as much
as Oliver was inclined to believe. Yet the boy
walked from the post-office with a firmer determination
to follow his purpose to its end and recognize
no such word as fail.</p>

<p>He spent the evening in writing a long reply to
his father, and also in sending several letters to intimate
friends, including one to Gus Gregory, which
was destined never to reach his chum for reasons that
will soon appear.</p>

<p>Oliver slept more comfortably that night than he
had the first. He was up, however, at seven o’clock;
and after getting breakfast and settling his bill made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
his way down to the steamer which was to afford
him passage to Aspinwall.</p>

<p>Here he found all bustle and confusion. Passengers
and the last of the cargo, as well as the mails,
were arriving all at the same time. He sought out
his stateroom and stowed away his valise, and then
went on deck to view the scene.</p>

<p>He wondered who his room-mate was to be; but
though he asked several he was unable to find out,
and no one appeared.</p>

<p>“Maybe I will have the room all to myself,” he
thought; “that will be much nicer.”</p>

<p>But the stream of people that were coming aboard
seemed to indicate otherwise. What a motley crowd
it was! Americans, Spaniards, Englishmen, several
Chinamen, and half a dozen blacks.</p>

<p>Surely time would not hang heavily among such
people. Oliver was already interested in the manners
and speeches to be seen and heard around him.</p>

<p>At length the time for sailing came; and lashed
fast to an energetic little steam-tug, the steamer
swung off from the pier and moved slowly down
the stream.</p>

<p>There was a crowd left behind that waved a parting
adieu, cheers and tears well mixed. On board
some were laughing, some crying.</p>

<p>Oliver felt mighty sober. There was no one to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
see him off; yet he was leaving home and friends
behind. When would he see all again?</p>

<p>Before long a tear stole down his cheek. He
brushed it away hastily and took a deep breath. How
he wished they were well on their way, and this
parting was over! And yet he strained his eyes
until the pier could be seen no longer, and eagerly
watched the shore with its varied shipping.</p>

<p>“No use in talking, there is nothing like home,”
he murmured to himself; “if it wasn’t for what I
hope to accomplish, you wouldn’t catch me leaving
it.”</p>

<p>Suddenly a snatch of song reached his ears,—</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The dearest spot on earth to me is home, sweet home.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“Paine spoke the truth when he wrote that,” said
Oliver to a man standing near.</p>

<p>“You’re right, Oliver,” added a voice from behind,
and turning, the boy was dumfounded to see Gus
Gregory standing close at hand.</p>

<small>THE STORM OFF CAPE HATTERAS.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>For the moment Oliver could not believe his eyesight.
He stared at his chum without saying a
word.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is I,” said Gus Gregory finally. “Do you
think it is my ghost?”</p>

<p>“Gus!” gasped Oliver. “Where in the world did
you come from?”</p>

<p>“Where did you suppose? From Rockvale.”</p>

<p>“And what—what are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“I’m bound for California; going to accompany
you.”</p>

<p>“You are! Why—why”—Oliver could not finish
the question.</p>

<p>“Don’t try to ask too many questions at once,
and perhaps I’ll answer some of them,” laughed the
stout boy. “In the first place, I left Rockvale yesterday
morning about eleven o’clock. I came at once
to New York, and after getting a good bath, so as
not to look quite like a tramp, I bought a ticket for
this steamer, and here I am.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but do your folks know of all this?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I guess not! I wouldn’t be here but for
the awful time I had with pop.”</p>

<p>And Gus Gregory shook his head over the remembrance
of the occurrence.</p>

<p>“Then you ran away?”</p>

<p>“I suppose you would call it that. But I didn’t
run; I couldn’t. I walked, and mighty slow at that!”</p>

<p>“But what made you come away at all?”</p>

<p>“It was all on account of that scrape we got into
over at Dr. Tangus’s. On Monday night pop called
me into the library, and said he had got a bill of
damages from the old man. What do you suppose
it was? Forty-five dollars!”</p>

<p>“Forty-five dollars! Phew!” ejaculated Oliver.
“That was the whole damage done, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“No; that was only my share. I can tell you
father was mad, and he sailed right into me. He
had been suffering from a toothache all day, and his
temper was none of the best. I can tell you I
caught it!”</p>

<p>Gus Gregory drew a deep breath and shifted his
shoulders uneasily.</p>

<p>“First it was words and then it came to blows,”
he resumed. “At last I said I wished I was a
thousand miles from home, and my father took me
up and said I could go and never come back; and
here I am.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>“But he didn’t mean that, Gus.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, he said it, and I took him up. So
that night I packed my grip,—had quite a job, I
was in such a tremendous hurry,—and found out all
about the steamer and so forth. I left home right
after breakfast.</p>

<p>“Just as I passed out of the garden, father saw
me, and called out to know where I was going. I
told him a thousand miles away, as he had wished.
He said I was a fool, and ordered me back. When
I didn’t mind, he came running after me. I started
up the road, with my eye on him over my shoulder.
I didn’t notice a puddle in the way, and the first
thing went a-sousing into it. Maybe I wasn’t a sight
to behold! I had on my best clothes too!”</p>

<p>Oliver laughed heartily. He could well imagine
the scene.</p>

<p>“But you got away?” he asked with deep interest.</p>

<p>“Of course; if I hadn’t I wouldn’t be here.
When I reached the station the train had just come
in. I jumped aboard, and in a moment we were off.
But what a mess I was in! I was mud from head
to foot, and my face resembled that of the worst
tramp you ever saw! I tried to clean myself as
best I could, but nevertheless every one stared at
me, and I had the whole seat to myself the entire
way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>“I can see the mud yet,” said Oliver.</p>

<p>“Humph! that isn’t a hundredth part of it. As
soon as I reached the city I hunted up a bath, and
told the proprietor I had met with an accident, and
he fixed me up. But I can tell you, Olly, I don’t
want any more such tumbles!”</p>

<p>“And where did you get your money to pay for
the trip?” asked Oliver.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I have a hundred dollars that Uncle Dick
left me before he started for Australia? I had that
and twenty-five dollars besides. I thought you would
take this steamer, and as soon as I saw your name
on the register, I engaged a berth too.”</p>

<p>“And what do you intend to do when you reach
San Francisco?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know yet. But see here, Olly, you don’t
act a bit as if you cared to have me with you,”
added Gus in injured tones.</p>

<p>“I do care a good deal. But I’m sorry you ran
away. What will your father and mother think of it?”</p>

<p>“I sent them a long letter just before we sailed,
so they won’t worry.”</p>

<p>“But they will worry, Gus.”</p>

<p>“Well, to tell the truth, I am sorry on mother’s
account. To be real candid, if I had stopped to
think perhaps I wouldn’t have come at all. But
now I am here, and that is all there is to it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p>Oliver shook his head. He knew well enough that
once Gus had made up his mind there was no use
to argue with him.</p>

<p>“Let us go below,” continued the stout boy; “I
have a surprise for you.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Never mind; come along.”</p>

<p>So Oliver followed him down the broad steps and
along the passageway, and Gus entered a stateroom.</p>

<p>“My stateroom!” cried Oliver. “How did you
know it?”</p>

<p>“By the register. It is mine also. We are to be
room-mates. Aren’t you glad?”</p>

<p>Glad? Indeed Oliver was. The feeling of loneliness,
so acute but a quarter of an hour before, was
all gone now.</p>

<p>While they were below, Gus told much of what
had passed in Rockvale after Oliver’s departure. To
be sure the boy had been gone but two days, yet
that was long enough for all the other boys to wonder
what had become of him.</p>

<p>Gus’s haste in leaving was amply proven by the
contents of his valise, all tumbled in one mess. There
were two extra shoes, but they were not mates, and
most of the clothing he had brought was just such
as he did not desire.</p>

<p>“Humph! the next time I run away I’d better<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
take a week to do it in!” he grumbled. “Did you
ever see such a collection? Looks as if I came out
of a junk-shop.”</p>

<p>“Never mind; I’ll lend you what I have,” said
Oliver. “But my advice is to return home the first
landing we make.”</p>

<p>“Not much! I’m bound West ho!”</p>

<p>In a little while the two boys went on deck again.
They were now drawing towards Sandy Hook, and
the heavy swells made Gus turn a sickly green.</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s about dinner time,” said Oliver;
“I feel mighty hungry.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want anything to eat,” replied the stout
boy, drawing his mouth tightly together.</p>

<p>“You don’t!”</p>

<p>“No; not a mouthful.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Never mind; I don’t, that’s all.”</p>

<p>Oliver gave him a searching glance.</p>

<p>“Gus Gregory, you’re seasick!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it; I’m only a bit dizzy,” was the
hopeful reply.</p>

<p>But he had hardly spoken the words before Gus
swallowed a lump in his throat and then rushed for
the side. Oliver, who felt perfectly well, could not
help but laugh.</p>

<p>He went to dinner alone. The table was more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
than three-quarters deserted—nearly every one was
under the weather. When he came from the dining-saloon
he found his chum in the stateroom flat on
the floor.</p>

<p>“What! as bad as this?” he asked kindly.</p>

<p>“Don’t say a word!” moaned Gus. “I’ll never
travel on the water again, never! I wish the steamer
was at the bottom of the sea, and myself with it.”</p>

<p>He continued to roll and moan for the rest of the
day. Oliver tried to help him in various ways, but
it was of no avail. There is nothing to do but to
let seasickness run its course.</p>

<p>The boys never forgot that first night on shipboard.
Several times Oliver’s head began to swim
from the motion, which towards morning grew worse.
He slept but little, and was one of the first on
deck.</p>

<p>“We are getting into the neighborhood of Cape
Hatteras,” said a gentleman standing near. “It
is always rough here, but more than usually so
now.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Oliver.</p>

<p>“Because there is a storm coming up.”</p>

<p>“A storm?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and a heavy one. Look over there at that
black mass of clouds. There will be lively times on
board to-day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>The gentleman spoke the truth. In less than a
quarter of an hour the sky was heavily overcast, and
a heavy rainstorm burst over their heads. Somewhat
fearful, Oliver hurried below.</p>

<p>He had often heard of the fearful storms experienced
off Cape Hatteras, and wondered if that which
was approaching would do the steamship any serious
damage.</p>

<small>MR. WHYLAND.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“My stars! what’s the matter with the ship?” asked
Gus, as Oliver entered the stateroom.</p>

<p>“We are going to have a storm,” was the reply;
“it’s raining already.”</p>

<p>“Then maybe we will go to the bottom,” groaned
Gus. “Or else we’ll turn clear over, see if we
don’t.”</p>

<p>He had been feeling just a trifle better, but now
he was worse. From looking green he was deadly
white, and he shook from head to foot.</p>

<p>“I wish I could do something for you,” said Oliver
kindly, for at least the fiftieth time. “But I don’t
know of a thing that will help you.”</p>

<p>“It’s a punishment for running away, I suppose.
I’ll never be well until we reach land again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense! You’ll feel all right as soon as
this storm clears off.”</p>

<p>Gus made no reply. Oliver remained in the stateroom
for a while, and then ventured above to take
another observation.</p>

<p>As he stepped on deck a violent gust of wind blew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
a man’s hat directly toward him. He made a dive
for the tile and captured it.</p>

<p>“Hello, there! got it?” sang out a voice, and an
instant later the gentleman who had told Oliver that
a storm was coming rushed up.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; here you are.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. My, but this is rough, and no mistake!”
The gentleman jammed the hat tightly over his head.
“Just look at those waves over there!” And he
pointed over to the starboard where the water appeared
to be mountainous in its height.</p>

<p>“I trust we will get through in safety,” said Oliver
with a shudder. “I have no desire to go to the bottom
of the sea.”</p>

<p>“Nor I,” laughed the gentleman. “Traveling
alone?” he went on curiously.</p>

<p>“I have a schoolmate with me—that is, we met
on board.”</p>

<p>“That very stout young man?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, I see. Rather young to be traveling
alone. I am glad to meet you. My name is Thomas
Whyland. I suppose we shall be thrown together
quite some during the voyage.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to San Francisco?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m glad to have met you,” said Oliver<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
with a smile. “I do not know a soul but my chum.
My name is Oliver Bright.”</p>

<p>The two shook hands. Mr. Whyland appeared to
be a pleasant gentleman, and Oliver thought they
would be friends. He did not dream how well acquainted
they were destined to become.</p>

<p>“Where is your chum now?” asked Mr. Whyland.</p>

<p>“In the stateroom, sick.”</p>

<p>As Oliver spoke a tremendous wave broke over
the deck, wetting both him and Mr. Whyland. A
moment later one of the deck-hands came forward
with word that all the passengers had been ordered
below.</p>

<p>“That means us too,” said Mr. Whyland. “Come,
let us adjourn to the cabin.”</p>

<p>It was with difficulty that they descended the companionway.
When half-way down Oliver slipped, and
had it not been for his friend would have rolled to
the bottom.</p>

<p>In the cabin they found a motley crowd assembled—mostly
passengers who were too frightened to
retire to their staterooms. Amongst them was the
head steward and two other officers, trying all they
could to quiet the fears that were expressed.</p>

<p>“Nothing unusual, sir,” said the steward to Oliver;
“I’ve passed through a dozen of ’em.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me; one is enough,” laughed the boy;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
“and you may depend upon it I will never forget
the experience.”</p>

<p>He and Mr. Whyland took a seat well forward, and
began to talk over the prospects. Presently Oliver
felt a hand on his arm, and turning, saw Gus standing
beside him.</p>

<p>“Hello! what brought you out?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I didn’t want to drown alone,” replied the stout
boy. “We’re all going to the bottom, do you know
it?”</p>

<p>“The officers of the boat say not,” returned Oliver.
“They say it is quite an ordinary storm.”</p>

<p>“I call it a most extraordinary, howling, rambunctious
cyclone,” said Gus. “I’m expecting the ship to
turn clear over any moment.”</p>

<p>Oliver introduced his companion to Mr. Whyland,
and their mutual sympathy soon placed them on the
plane of friendship. But Gus was too sick to remain
long, and before a great while retired again to the
stateroom, whither he was presently followed by
Oliver.</p>

<p>“What do you think of Mr. Whyland?” asked the
latter.</p>

<p>“Very nice man,” returned Gus. “I’d like him
still better if he would only order this storm to stop.
Creation! it seems to me I’d give all I’m worth to
be on land once more!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>“Then you don’t think you would care to be a
sailor, to sail the briny deep?” asked Oliver with a
smile.</p>

<p>“Sailor!” Gus uttered the word in deep disgust.</p>

<p>“Yes. It’s a splendid life—at least so the novelists
say.”</p>

<p>“Humph! I guess those novelists never saw the
blue and black water, or they wouldn’t put down
any such nonsense! No, sir! this is my first and last
trip on the flowing sea. As Paddy said, ‘The next
time I ship I’ll travel be land!’”</p>

<p>“Which means that when you return home you’ll
do so overland.”</p>

<p>“If I’m ever allowed to return home, which I very
much doubt, if this confounded storm keeps up.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it isn’t so bad, Gus.” Oliver mused for a
moment, while Gus turned on the berth with a groan.
“I wonder if Mr. Whyland is acquainted in San
Francisco.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“If he is, he may be able to give me considerable
information about the place.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t likely that he ever heard of this Colonel
Mendix.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose not; but he will know about the
mining exchange and all that, and that is what I must
learn about. They must know something of Mendix.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
He couldn’t keep that mine a secret so long out
there.”</p>

<p>“Suppose you can’t find out a single thing in San
Francisco, what then?”</p>

<p>“It will be a disappointment, but I shall not give
up. I will make a hunt up the river upon which it
is said to be situated. Sooner or later I am bound
to stumble upon a clew.”</p>

<p>“I admire your grit, Olly. You deserve success.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll obtain it, mark my word, Gus.”</p>

<p>During the afternoon, instead of abating, the storm
grew wilder. The sky became even blacker than before,
and all the lanterns were lit. The wind shrieked
through the rigging and across the deck, and everything
that was loose and light was carried over the
rail.</p>

<p>Seated on the edge of the lower berth the two
boys talked in a low tone. Sleep was out of the
question, and, as Gus expressed it, somehow speech
made them more courageous.</p>

<p>“We must be near Cape Hatteras,” said Oliver.
“If we—”</p>

<p>He did not finish the sentence, for at that instant
a terrible shock was felt that sent both boys sprawling
to the other side of the stateroom. There was a crashing
and a tearing, and they heard piercing cries of
alarm. What did it mean?</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.<br />
<small>ARRIVAL AT ASPINWALL.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Both boys were frightened at the terrific shock they
experienced while in the stateroom. Gus had the wind
completely knocked out of him, and Oliver was little
better off.</p>

<p>“What can it mean?” cried Oliver as he scrambled
to his feet.</p>

<p>“Guess we’ve smashed on the rocks!” groaned the
stout youth. “Told you we’d go to the bottom.”</p>

<p>“If we have, I’m not going to stay below any longer.
Come, let us go on deck.”</p>

<p>Oliver helped Gus to regain his feet, and trembling
with excitement as well as fear, they made their
way to the cabin. Here nearly all the passengers
were assembled, most of them in a high state of excitement.</p>

<p>Among the crowd was Mr. Whyland, who quickly
joined the boys.</p>

<p>“What is it? What have we struck?” asked
Oliver anxiously.</p>

<p>“I do not know. It was a fearful blow.”</p>

<p>“Are we going to the bottom?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p>“Hardly. These steamers are very strongly built.
I’ll go on deck and find out.”</p>

<p>But at the companionway he was stopped.</p>

<p>“No one allowed on deck,” said the man in charge
of the stairs. “There is no danger, sir.”</p>

<p>“What did we strike?”</p>

<p>“Struck a small freight schooner, and carried away
her bow.”</p>

<p>“Did she sink?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. But we are steaming near her so as to
be on the safe side.”</p>

<p>This news was heard by every one who stood
around, and its effect was to quiet the fearful ones.
Many wondered if the schooner was seriously damaged,
and if she would be able to continue her
voyage.</p>

<p>It is safe to say that there was little or no sleep
that night for those on board the steamer. Towards
morning the storm cleared off, and the sun rose
bright as ever.</p>

<p>“Well, I never!” declared Gus. “The scene has
changed as quickly as it does in a panorama!”</p>

<p>Now that the dreadful rolling had ceased, he felt
better, and Oliver was glad to see him indulge in
a fair-sized breakfast.</p>

<p>The meal finished, they went on deck. The freight
schooner that had been struck was nowhere to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
seen. Inquiries brought the information that she had
not been seriously damaged and had gone on her way.</p>

<p>The two boys found the day rather monotonous.
Look where they might, nothing could be seen but
sky and water, the one nearly as blue as the other.</p>

<p>“Blue all around makes one feel blue,” remarked
Gus. “But I’m thankful I’m over that awful seasickness.
If it had kept up much longer I believe I
would have died.”</p>

<p>“No one ever dies of seasickness,” said Mr. Whyland,
who had come up. “Your health will be
better after this dose.”</p>

<p>“Well, it ought to be,” laughed Gus. “I’ve suffered
enough. I ought to have some reward.”</p>

<p>“But we do not always get what we deserve in
this world,” responded the gentleman, and for a
moment a light shadow swept across his brow.
“Sometimes both evil and good pass us by.”</p>

<p>At dinner Oliver did full justice to what was
passed to him. Gus felt decidedly strange, and it
was some time before he could get into the peculiar
way of eating that was prevalent. Everything that
he had, seemed to be inclined to slide into his lap.</p>

<p>“We can’t stand on much ceremony,” he said. “I
think this chicken leg is better in my stomach than
on the floor, so here goes.” And he took the extremity
of the fowl between his fingers and ate it
that way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p>That day and the next passed slowly. Gus was
of the opinion they would stop at some place before
reaching Aspinwall, but in this he was mistaken.
They passed close to the coast of Florida, so close in
fact that the sandy shore with the tall and waving
trees and bushes could be distinctly seen. On the
following day they took the course between Cuba
and Yucatan, passing not far from the latter on account
of the tide. They were now in the Caribbean
Sea, with the Bay of Honduras behind them.</p>

<p>“Looks very much like any other bay or gulf, I
suppose,” observed Gus, as he and Oliver stood by
the rail watching some sea-gulls as they winged their
way around the ship.</p>

<p>“I guess water looks very much the same in all
parts of the earth,” was Oliver’s reply.</p>

<p>“Mostly,” put in Mr. Whyland, who had overheard
the last words; “although there are some
places where it is quite different. Lake Como in
Switzerland is as blue as indigo; the waters of some
South American rivers are intensely green; and then
there are the Red and Black Seas—so called from
their general appearance.”</p>

<p>“I should like to see them all,” returned Oliver.
“Some day, if I am able, I intend to become a great
traveler.”</p>

<p>“It is very pleasant,” said the gentleman. “But it
takes a lot of money, I can assure you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>Early on the day following, land somewhere on
the isthmus was seen; and late in the afternoon they
steamed into the harbor at Aspinwall, and dropped
anchor. The boys were eager to go ashore, but were
told that no passengers would be allowed to land
until the following morning.</p>

<p>“Well, so much of the journey is done,” said
Oliver. “How I wish this was San Francisco Bay!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know as I do,” returned Gus. “Now
that I’ve got over that nasty seasickness, I rather
enjoy the trip.”</p>

<p>“I would too, if I didn’t have anything on my
mind.”</p>

<p>“Well, you ought not to let that interfere. Worry
won’t do any good.”</p>

<p>In the fast approaching darkness but little could
be seen. The boys were sure Aspinwall was a poorly
illuminated town, so few lights could be distinguished.
They went below and made all necessary preparations
for leaving the steamer.</p>

<p>The evening passed quickly. At ten o’clock the
boys turned in so as to be on hand bright and early.</p>

<p>And on hand they were. At ten o’clock both
stepped out on the dock and walked slowly up the
narrow and dirty street.</p>

<p>“Humph! not much of a city,” said Gus. “See
the funny houses all on stilts!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<p>“I suppose they build them that way to keep from
getting flooded out when it rains,” laughed Oliver;
“or else the sea may occasionally drive in too far.”</p>

<p>“I would not care to see myself living here. My,
how muddy it is! I guess they haven’t much of a
street-cleaning department.”</p>

<p>From one of the officers of the ship the boys learned
that, in order to make connections with the steamer at
Panama, they would have to take the train for that
port on the following morning.</p>

<p>“That will give us a whole day in this place,” said
Oliver. “Come, let us start out on a voyage of discovery.”</p>

<p>Gus was nothing loath, and they set out. They
passed down the main street, where they discovered
several fine-looking hotels,—quite in contrast with
their shabby surroundings,—and then turned down
another road close beside the water.</p>

<p>Most all of the people they met were either Spaniards,
Frenchmen, or natives. But few Americans
were to be seen, and this made both boys feel more
strange than did all the other surroundings.</p>

<p>“We are in a different country, and no mistake,”
said Oliver. “See what queer ways the folks have!
It makes me feel like a cat in a strange garret!”</p>

<p>Presently they drifted into quite a crowd that lined
a wharf where a large boat was discharging fruit.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
Anxious to see what was going on, they pressed their
way to the front until a tall Spaniard with a long whip
rushed out, and jabbering at all the strangers, drove
them off.</p>

<p>“Not a very sociable fellow,” grunted Gus. “By
crickety! I thought he was going to fetch me one
across the legs!”</p>

<p>It was now getting toward noon, and both boys were
hungry. Oliver was for going back to the steamer for
dinner, but Gus persuaded him to enter one of the
strange eating-houses kept by a native.</p>

<p>“I want to see what kind of stuff they furnish,” he
explained.</p>

<p>“All right. Only you must order,” replied Oliver.</p>

<p>So Gus ordered dinner as best he could. While
they were waiting for it to be brought both boys felt
in their pockets for money to pay for it. Neither had
so much as a cent!</p>

<small>MR. WHYLAND’S STORY.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Have you any money?” gasped Gus.</p>

<p>“No,” returned Oliver; and he added, “I have been
robbed! I had nearly two dollars in change when I
left the steamer.”</p>

<p>“Then I am luckier than you, for I remember now
that I left my purse in my valise. What are we to
do?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” returned Oliver blankly. “I’ll
bet I was robbed down in that crowd at the wharf.”</p>

<p>“Most likely.”</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing I didn’t have more with me. I
suppose I’ll never see that money again.”</p>

<p>“You’re right. To get it back would probably be
more bother than it is worth. Still, I would tell the
captain when we get back.”</p>

<p>“I certainly shall. In the meanwhile how are we
to pay for our meal here?”</p>

<p>“I suppose we had better not eat it. Let us tell
the waiter what has happened.”</p>

<p>In a moment more the Frenchman who had taken
their order appeared, his tray piled high with dishes.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
Gus told their story, and motioned as if to go away.
Evidently the man did not understand the stout youth,
for his face grew dark.</p>

<p>“You have ordered the meal; you must pay for it,”
he said in French.</p>

<p>Of course Gus did not understand him, and only
shook his head. This made the man angry, and he
called the proprietor, and the two talked to both boys
in a high pitch of voice. Oliver turned his pockets
inside out and Gus did the same, but even this had
no effect save to make the proprietor of the place
grow pale with passion.</p>

<p>“It’s no use,” cried Oliver. “They think we are
only trying to fool them, that we never intended to
take dinner here. What in the world shall we do?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.” Gus gave a gasp. “I wonder
if they will dare to have us arrested?”</p>

<p>“Arrested? Oh, I trust not!” Oliver looked
about him in deep perplexity; “but I cannot imagine
what is best to do.”</p>

<p>At that instant the boy’s gaze was turned towards
the door, and he was overjoyed to see Mr. Whyland
enter. Breaking from the group, he ran up to him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Whyland, how glad I am that you came
in!” he exclaimed. “My friend and I have got into
an awful muss.”</p>

<p>“Is that so? What is the trouble?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p>As briefly as he could Oliver related the misfortune
that had overtaken himself and Gus. Mr. Whyland
listened attentively.</p>

<p>“It is too bad you have had your money stolen,”
he said. “There is no use in trying to recover it.
It would certainly take more time and trouble than
it is worth. You must be more careful in the future.”</p>

<p>“I intend to be. But what shall I do here? The
proprietor insists that I want to cheat him or else
am fooling him.”</p>

<p>“I will pay the bill. I suppose travelers often impose
upon him and he has grown suspicious. I will
speak to him in French.”</p>

<p>Mr. Whyland was as good as his word. The restaurant
keeper listened closely, and then began to
bow and smile, and sent the waiter off for more stuff.</p>

<p>“I have told him that I will settle the bill and
that I will have dinner with you,” explained Mr.
Whyland. “He says only last week a party of three
Americans came in and fooled him, and he thought
you belonged to the same crowd.”</p>

<p>“They ought to have been ashamed of themselves,”
sniffed Gus. “Might have got us into a terrible
mess.”</p>

<p>“Yes; Americans away from home ought to be more
circumspect in their actions. A few of them can give
the entire nation a bad name.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<p>The things that Mr. Whyland had ordered were
not long in coming, and then the three sat down. It
was a somewhat different meal from what they had
been accustomed to at home, yet not enough so to
make it noticeable.</p>

<p>“These people are very quick to remember how
Americans like things served,” said Mr. Whyland.
“That is why you do not notice any great difference
from a Broadway restaurant.”</p>

<p>The meal finished, their friend settled the bill as
he had agreed. Oliver and Gus thanked him, and
the former promised to pay back their share as soon
as the steamer was reached.</p>

<p>“There is no need to trouble yourself. It was but
fifty cents—twenty-five apiece,” said Mr. Whyland.
“What were you young men doing? taking a look
around?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Oliver; “but there doesn’t seem
to be much to see.”</p>

<p>“You are right; Aspinwall is not a very attractive
city—that is, by comparison with what we have left.
It is almost too unhealthy to thrive.”</p>

<p>On the way back to the steamer the three became
even better acquainted than before. The gentleman
asked where the two boys were bound, and stepped
back in astonishment when Oliver, in a burst of confidence,
told him that, while Gus was off merely for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
a trip, he himself was in quest of a hidden mine
in California.</p>

<p>“Surely, surely you are joking!” gasped Mr. Whyland.</p>

<p>“No, sir; I am telling the truth,” affirmed Oliver.
“I would not tell you at all, but you have been so
kind to me.”</p>

<p>“And may I ask where this mine is situated—in
what direction?”</p>

<p>“It is somewhere on the Mokelumne River.”</p>

<p>“And is it called the Aurora Mine?” continued
Mr. Whyland with intense interest.</p>

<p>“It is!” cried Oliver. “But how did you know
the name?”</p>

<p>“I am looking for the same mine myself.”</p>

<p>“You!”</p>

<p>“Exactly. Do you know the owner of the claim?”</p>

<p>“My father owns the claim,” replied Oliver decidedly.</p>

<p>“But Colonel Mendix”—</p>

<p>“Do you know that man?” asked Oliver quickly.</p>

<p>“Quite well, although I have not seen him for two
years. He sold me a quarter interest in the mine
for ten thousand dollars, and then he disappeared.”</p>

<p>“My father gave him a quarter interest to open
up the mine for him. That must be the interest he
sold you. You say you have not seen Colonel Mendix<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
for two years; I saw him in New York the day
before we sailed.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible?”</p>

<p>“I tried to meet him to have a talk with him; but
before I could do so he took the train for the West.”</p>

<p>Mr. Whyland was astonished over what Oliver had
to say. He asked the boy to tell his story, and as
Oliver could see no harm in so doing, he complied.</p>

<p>“From what you say we are undoubtedly on the
same errand,” remarked Mr. Whyland when he had
finished. “You are searching for your father’s share,
and I am searching for the share given to Colonel
Mendix, which that individual transferred to me. It
is most fortunate that we met. If you have no objection
we will work together.”</p>

<p>“I shall be happy to do so, Mr. Whyland. You
are a man, and a man can, as a rule, do more than a
boy.”</p>

<p>“But I take you to be a remarkably bright boy,”
laughed the gentleman. “I am sure we will get
along famously together. I have not much to tell,
excepting that I met Colonel Mendix in Boston,
where he was introduced to me by James Barr, the
surveyor you have mentioned. By Mr. Barr’s advice
I invested in the mine. I waited for a long
time to hear from the two, but never did. Other
business claimed my attention. But now I am free<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
to hunt the matter up, and I intend to do so. The
amount at stake is not a large one to me; but still
I wish to learn positively whether I have been swindled
or not.”</p>

<p>“The amount is a good deal to my father,” said
Oliver. “He has lost all of his other property, and
this is his last hope.”</p>

<p>“Then I trust that for his sake as well as for my
own the mine proves of value.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to find it first,” put in Gus. “Remember
the old saying about counting chickens before
they are hatched.”</p>

<p>“I would say, don’t count the eggs before they
are found,” laughed Mr. Whyland. “But we will
trust for the best.”</p>

<p>The three talked over the situation for a long time.
Oliver was glad that he had run across Mr. Whyland.
It would undoubtedly lighten his task to a great degree.
The gentleman was experienced and rich, and
that would count for a good deal in what was to come.</p>

<p>The remainder of the day passed quickly. In the
evening they went aboard of the steamer for the last
time. All slept soundly, and were up at a seasonable
hour.</p>

<p>“What an odd little railroad!” remarked Gus, as
they boarded the train in the morning. “Only a
single track.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>“It is only about forty-eight miles long,” said Mr.
Whyland, “but it cost an enormous sum of money
to build.”</p>

<p>Soon there was a tremendous jerk, and they were
off on the trip across the isthmus. Oliver looked out
of the window at the marshy ground, and the rank
pools of stagnant water.</p>

<p>Suddenly they came to a sharp stop. What was
up now?</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<small>IN THE WILDS OF THE ISTHMUS.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Oliver calculated that they had been traveling not
more than an hour when the sudden stoppage occurred.
The shock was so great it threw him up against the
seat in front of him, and awoke Gus from a comfortable
nap.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” exclaimed the stout youth
in alarm.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” was Oliver’s reply. “Something
wrong ahead, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps part of the roadbed has sunk,” suggested
Mr. Whyland, who sat on the other side of the aisle.
“I understand such a thing frequently occurs here.”</p>

<p>They all sat quiet for ten minutes. By this time
one and another of the passengers began to get out,
and finally the three joined them, and walked up to
where the engine stood, blowing off steam.</p>

<p>Mr. Whyland’s surmise proved correct. Not fifty
feet distant the rails of the road were submerged in a
murky pool of foul-smelling water. The length of
the depression was about one hundred feet, and its
greatest depth a foot and a half.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>Already a gang of native laborers were at work repairing
the damage. There were a dozen or more of
them, but they worked so slowly that hardly any
progress was made.</p>

<p>“Seems to me if I was overseer here I would hurry
those men up,” remarked Gus, after they had watched
the proceedings for some time.</p>

<p>“They cannot hurry much,” said Mr. Whyland.
“The climate is against them. I doubt if you could
stand the work more than an hour. Come, let us get
away from that pool. It is a regular hotbed of fever.”</p>

<p>“I wonder how long this will delay us?” said
Oliver, as they walked back to the car.</p>

<p>“Suppose we ask the conductor?” said Gus.</p>

<p>After some little trouble they found the man, who
was surrounded by a crowd of passengers, all eager
to know what would be the result of the delay.</p>

<p>“We will go through as soon as possible,” he replied.
“The men will work hard, and I think in two hours,
or three at the most, we will be able to move.”</p>

<p>“Three hours!” exclaimed Oliver. “That is quite
a time.”</p>

<p>“Let us spend it in exploring the vicinity,” suggested
Gus.</p>

<p>Oliver was agreeable. Mr. Whyland did not care
to go, but sat down to read a magazine, and the two
boys started off alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>“We won’t go far,” said Oliver. “I suppose they
will blow the whistle before they start, so that we can
get back.”</p>

<p>In five minutes the boys were in a veritable forest.
On every side could be seen tall palms, interspersed
with cocoa, sycamore, and other tropical trees. Beneath
their feet grew a rank vegetation, and wherever
there was a bit of water, gorgeous lilies sprang up,
the like of which they had never before beheld.</p>

<p>And the birds and monkeys overhead! Never had
they seen such a sight, and it seemed they would
never get done wondering over it. Every tree was
full, and the air resounded with sweet song and
senseless chatter.</p>

<p>“Those monkeys beat any menagerie show I ever
saw!” declared Gus, as they stood watching two old
fellows, who had evidently got into a dispute over
the ownership of a particular cocoanut.</p>

<p>“My, just hear them call each other names! See,
now the black has got it! But the red won’t let him
keep it. See, he has it now, and is going to break it
open. There! the black has it again, and he—well,
by crickety!”</p>

<p>As Gus uttered the last word he dodged, and just in
time. The monkey who held the nut had discovered
that he was being watched, and without ceremony had
hurled the nut at the stout youth’s head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<p>“Thank you for the nut,” said Gus, picking it up
and bowing in mock politeness, “but next time please
don’t present it so forcibly.”</p>

<p>Going to a tree, he endeavored to break the shell
of the cocoanut by hammering the article against the
trunk. As he did so, two more nuts landed beside
him.</p>

<p>“Hello! what does this mean?” he exclaimed.
“Did I knock those down?”</p>

<p>“No, you didn’t; they threw them,” replied Oliver.
“We had better get out of here before we have our
heads cracked open. Look out!” and he dodged just
as a perfect volley came raining down.</p>

<p>One of the nuts just grazed Gus’s ear, causing him
to cry out with pain. He dropped the nut he held
and ran across the clearing, followed by Oliver.</p>

<p>“By crickety! but that was a narrow escape!” he
cried when they were once more safe. “If one of
those nuts had hit us, it would have ended our existence
right then and there.”</p>

<p>“It will teach us a lesson to mind our own business,”
returned Oliver. “I suppose that monkey
thought we had no right to spy into his affairs.”</p>

<p>“I would like to own a monkey,” observed Gus;
“that is, one that is peaceful. I always thought
them so cute.”</p>

<p>“They are cute, but not always in the way you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
imagine. Come, I suppose we ought to be getting
back.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there is lots of time! Why, we haven’t
been gone half an hour yet. Just wait; I want to
pick some of those splendid flowers growing near
that pond.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t, Gus; for all you know they may be
poisonous.”</p>

<p>“Do you think they are? They are awfully
pretty.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; but they might be, and you had
better be on the safe side.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get just one of each. Here, let me have your
knife.” Gus took Oliver’s knife and cut off the
flowers he wished. “Phew, what a nasty smell!”
he cried in disgust. “That’s the worst of it, with
so many pretty flowers. The smell—oh, my! how
they burn! My hand is on fire!”</p>

<p>He threw the flowers away from him and danced
around in pain, shaking his hands in the air.</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope you have not been poisoned!” cried
Oliver. “Go wash your hands in the pool.”</p>

<p>“You won’t catch me fooling around any flowers
again; that is, strange ones,” said Gus, as he did as
directed. “My, what a nasty place this is! No
wonder the railroads have to offer a man a small fortune
to work for them. I wouldn’t—Oh, Oliver,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
look! what is that?” And straightening up, the
stout youth pointed to the opposite side of the bit
of water. “It looked like the head of a turtle or
something,” he went on. “I wonder if there are
any turtles here?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why there shouldn’t be. Still it
might have been something else. Let us go.”</p>

<p>“Wait till I have a shy at it with this gourd.” Gus
poised the gourd in his hand and let drive. “There!
I reckon I hit him. Oh, my stars!”</p>

<p>Gus tumbled back in great haste, and Oliver did
the same. The supposed turtle’s head had suddenly
lifted, and there was revealed a hissing snake, fully
eight feet long.</p>

<p>“A snake!” cried both.</p>

<p>For an instant the reptile seemed to stand nearly
upright, its eyes glittering, and its slimy body quivering
with anger. Then with a final hiss it darted
headfirst into the pool and disappeared.</p>

<p>“Huh! that gives me a chill!” cried Gus. “I
wonder where he has gone?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he is coming after us,” replied Oliver.
“Let us get out of here as fast as we can.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he will make his appearance again,
but still we had better go. There may be more.”</p>

<p>“There are!” cried Oliver. “See there!” He
pointed almost under their feet and pulled Gus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
away. “That is the same or his mate. Let us run
for it.”</p>

<p>There was no necessity for the last words, for both
were running as fast as the nature of the ground
would permit. The snake followed for a short distance,
and then was lost to view.</p>

<p>But the boys kept right on, and it was not until
both found themselves in a perfect labyrinth of undergrowth
that they slackened their pace and finally
came to a stop.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven we have got away from him,”
exclaimed Gus, puffing to catch his breath. “Huh!
I can almost feel him coiling around my body!”</p>

<p>“So can I,” returned Oliver. “Of all things to
meet I think a snake is the worst. I would just as
lief encounter a tiger or a lion.”</p>

<p>“Let us get back at once,” said Gus; “I won’t
feel safe until I am in the car, and when I am you
won’t catch me leaving the train again until we arrive
at Panama.”</p>

<p>“Just my sentiments,” rejoined Oliver. “Let us—”</p>

<p>He stopped short. “Where are we?”</p>

<p>Both suddenly gazed around them in alarm. Which
way should they turn? Neither knew. They were
lost in the forest!</p>

<small>AN ADVENTURE ON THE ISTHMUS.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Lost in the forest! Oliver and Gus looked at
each other with blanched faces. Here indeed was
a sorry situation. What was to be done?</p>

<p>On every side could be seen nothing but the dense
undergrowth and tall trees. They might be only a
hundred feet from the railroad, or they might be a
mile away.</p>

<p>“We were very foolish not to note the path,” said
Oliver. “Have you any idea which way we ought
to turn?”</p>

<p>“I have not, excepting that we might trace the
way back to that pool,” answered Gus. “And I don’t
want to do that if I can help it,” he added with
a shudder. “I’d rather tramp five miles than face
those snakes again.”</p>

<p>“So would I. But we must try some way. Here,
let us see if we cannot get our bearings by the
sun. Now, I think this is the right direction,” went
on Oliver, after a careful survey of the light overhead.</p>

<p>“And I think it is this way,” affirmed Gus, pointing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
out a course directly at right angles with the
other. “Come, let us try that opening beyond.”</p>

<p>Gus insisted that he was right, and somewhat
against his will, Oliver followed his chum. They
crossed the clearing, and then plunged into another
mass of bushes and vines, the stout lad leading.</p>

<p>“Hold up!” he shouted suddenly. “Don’t come
any farther, or you’ll get into a regular bog-hole!”
And he turned and hastily scrambled back to where
Oliver stood.</p>

<p>“It’s lucky I stopped where I did,” he went on;
“if we hadn’t we would have got into a pool worse
than the other one was. My! what a beastly place
this is!”</p>

<p>More dismayed than ever, they made their way
back to the clearing. Something must be done, but
what?</p>

<p>“If we don’t get back soon, the train will leave
without us,” said Oliver. “Come, let us try the
direction I thought was right.” And off they started
as fast as they could.</p>

<p>It was miserable walking, and before they had proceeded
a hundred steps both had their feet wet, and
unfortunate Gus had his coat torn in a dozen places.</p>

<p>“It’s positively the worst place I ever got into!”
he groaned. “If we don’t get out soon I won’t have
a patch of clothing left.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<p>On and on they went, until Oliver called a halt.</p>

<p>“No use to go farther. If this was the right road
we would have crossed the track long ago. We are
going wrong, and that is all there is to it.”</p>

<p>“But what shall we do?” demanded Gus, more
dismayed than ever. “We can’t stand still here.”</p>

<p>Oliver leaned against a tree. Truly their position
was far from enviable. Suppose they should be left,
what would they do when night came on?</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he replied in a low voice. “If
we could only—hark! what is that?”</p>

<p>Both listened intently. From a distance came the
unmistakable sound of a steam-whistle.</p>

<p>“It’s the locomotive!” cried Gus. “They are getting
ready to start!”</p>

<p>“Hurry up,” cried Oliver. “Come, this way.”</p>

<p>And he sprang off through the bushes at the top
of his speed. It was a rough journey, but what was
that compared to the agonizing thought that they
might be left behind?</p>

<p>Fortunately the steam-whistle continued sounding,
and it proved a good guide; for in ten minutes more
they reached the railroad track, and just beyond stood
the train, all ready to start.</p>

<p>“Thank fortune!” cried Oliver, and he waved his
hand to the conductor to wait for them.</p>

<p>In another moment they were safe on board and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
in their seats, and then the train with a final warning
moved off.</p>

<p>“Where have you two been?” asked Mr. Whyland,
gazing in astonishment at their torn clothing and wet
feet; “I was very much afraid you might miss the
train.”</p>

<p>“You weren’t half as much scared about it as we
were,” responded Gus ruefully.</p>

<p>Oliver told their story. Mr. Whyland smiled, but
shook his head.</p>

<p>“Both of you want to be more careful,” he said.
“Those flowers may have been poisonous, and also
the snakes. It is well enough to go out on a tour
of inspection, but one must be mighty cautious.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not leave the car until we reach Panama,”
affirmed Gus, and he was as good as his word.</p>

<p>The train moved along slowly, as if feeling its way.
Gus said he could very well walk about as fast; but
when Oliver suggested that he get out and try it,
the stout youth begged to be excused.</p>

<p>On the way they passed a number of villages, none
of them very large, and many of them merely a collection
of bamboo huts, with a big pole in the center,
and covered over for the most part with palm leaves.
The natives appeared to be quite respectable, but not
over fond of work. Here and there a group could
be seen moving slowly about, and singing to themselves;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
or they were to be found in a corner dozing,
or contentedly smoking their tobacco.</p>

<p>“It’s a lazy life,” said Oliver, “but I suppose the
climate has something to do with it.”</p>

<p>“It has everything to do with it,” replied Mr. Whyland.
“Still, the people here are more industrious
than they used to be before the railroad was built.”</p>

<p>Once the train came to a standstill. It was a sort
of a station, and on the platform stood a number of
the natives of the place—tall, and not bad-looking
fellows.</p>

<p>One of them held an immense quantity of small
wares by a string over his shoulder, and was trying
to dispose of them. He approached the window at
which Oliver and Gus were sitting, and could hardly
be made to take “no” for an answer.</p>

<p>“I don’t want any,” said Gus, for at least the tenth
time.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Si caballeros</i>,” the native insisted. “Yes, gentlemen,
only feety centa.”</p>

<p>To get rid of the fellow they at last closed the window,
and then the man went off in apparent anger.</p>

<p>“They have an idea down here that all Americans
are rich, and free to spend their money,” said
Mr. Whyland. “The same idea prevails in Europe,
and American tourists are generally made to pay a
little more for what they purchase than other folks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mind having some of the things he
had to sell, but I have no money to spare,” remarked
Oliver.</p>

<p>“Just my case,” put in Gus. “And it makes me
mad enough to have to say no, without having some
one insist the other way.”</p>

<p>The remainder of the journey took but a short while.
Soon the train rolled past a number of ancient and
squalid-looking houses, and Mr. Whyland announced
that they had reached the outskirts of Panama.</p>

<p>But around the odd-looking station things were not
so bad. To be sure all was new and strange to the
boys, and they kept their eyes wide open for all such
sights.</p>

<p>“They often have most outrageous bull-fights here,”
said Mr. Whyland as they alighted.</p>

<p>“I should like to see one,” rejoined Gus. “Not
that I would enjoy the sport, but it would be so
strange.”</p>

<p>“I would not care to go,” put in Oliver. “I
think it is too cruel!”</p>

<p>“It is the height of cruelty,” responded Mr. Whyland.
“I went once. It was held on a Sunday, and
a friend insisted that I should accompany him. When
the poor beasts were brought out, and a number of
things done to enrage them, I was disgusted; and
when the fight began I grew sick, not only at heart,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
but physically as well. What sport there is in the
thing I cannot see.”</p>

<p>“Nor can any one else who has any heart,” said
Oliver decidedly; “it is nothing short of barbarism.”</p>

<p>“I wonder when our steamer leaves?” observed
Gus, as they walked out upon the street.</p>

<p>“To-morrow morning at ten o’clock. At least,
that is what the conductor said,” replied Oliver.</p>

<p>“Suppose we go to the office and make sure,”
said Mr. Whyland. “We do not wish to take any
chances. They often make changes here.”</p>

<p>So off for the office of the steamship company
they started. It was not a great distance, and it
took them but a few minutes.</p>

<p>As they neared the spot, they met a number of
their fellow-passengers returning with fallen looks.</p>

<p>“Something is wrong,” said Oliver. “I just heard
that man in brown say it was a shame to be kept
waiting so long. Something has happened.”</p>

<p>They were not long in finding out what that something
was. In entering the harbor, the steamship had
got one of her wheels caught in some wreckage and
badly damaged. She must be laid up for repairs, and
passengers would have to wait for the next steamer.</p>

<p>“And how long will that be?” asked Oliver ruefully.</p>

<p>“Ten days,” was the reply.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<small>A CHANGE OF PLAN.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It was dismaying news. Ten days to wait in
Panama! To the boys, especially to Oliver, it seemed
an eternity.</p>

<p>“Might as well settle down here,” grumbled Gus.
“What in the world are we to do, caged up in this
dreary place for a week and a half?”</p>

<p>“The company will have to board us,” remarked
Mr. Whyland, who was disposed to make the best
of the matter. “As far as that goes it will be their
loss, not ours.”</p>

<p>“But I do not wish to lose the time. I suppose
Colonel Mendix is already in San Francisco, or maybe
even on his way to the mine,” said Oliver.</p>

<p>“That is true. But what can we do?”</p>

<p>“I wonder if there are no other ships that carry
passengers?” asked Oliver. “In a place like this
there ought to be.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we’ve got our tickets,” put in Gus. “I
can’t afford to lose the amount I paid on mine.”</p>

<p>“We won’t lose that,” replied Mr. Whyland.
“The company will have to take them back for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
what they are worth if they cannot carry us at the
stipulated time. But is there any other steamer?”</p>

<p>“I suppose we can find out by going down to the
different offices,” said Oliver. “Suppose we do that
before they close for the day?”</p>

<p>“A good plan,” rejoined Mr. Whyland. “I do
not care to remain here any more than you do.”</p>

<p>Stopping an Englishman whom they met, they
secured directions to the various shipping-offices, and
then started for the nearest at once.</p>

<p>“The Neolia sails in four days,” was the reply
received here; “but the passenger list is full. No
more can be taken.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care much,” remarked Gus when they
were once more outside. “Four days to wait are
nearly as bad as ten. Maybe we will find something
that goes to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Small chance of that, I think,” said Mr. Whyland.
“Still, let us try.”</p>

<p>In five minutes they were at another office. Here
they were told that no vessel would sail within several
days, and nearly every one was full.</p>

<p>“I thought it would be so,” said Mr. Whyland
when they stood outside once more. “Perhaps the
steamship company has bought up the places.”</p>

<p>At that moment a man with a nautical bearing
stepped up and tapped Oliver on the shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>“Excuse me,” said he; “but didn’t I see you in
the steamship office inquiring about passage to San
Francisco?”</p>

<p>“You did,” replied Oliver. “What of it?”</p>

<p>“Maybe I can accommodate ye, seeing as how the
Polly Eliza is going to sail first thing to-morrow
morning,” responded the stranger. “My name is
Morris, Niles Morris, and I’m part owner and captain
of the Polly Eliza, as trim a little coast steamer
as there is in these parts. If you want to ship with
me, now is your chance, one or all of ye.”</p>

<p>Oliver looked at the man. He was short and stout,
with a ruddy face, and his voice had a hearty ring.</p>

<p>“We do want passage,” said Oliver. “What do
you say?” the last to Mr. Whyland.</p>

<p>“We would like to see your vessel,” replied that
gentleman. “Is she lying anywhere near?”</p>

<p>“Just down at the end of the bay. Come right
along with me and I’ll show ye. You’ll find her
with first-class accommodations, even if she is small.”</p>

<p>Captain Morris led the way along the street, down
a long wharf, and into a small rowboat. In five minutes
they reached a spot where a neat-looking steamer
was lying. They were taken aboard, and found what
her captain had said was true. All was as new as a
pin, and it pleased the boys as well as Mr. Whyland.</p>

<p>“And you sail to-morrow morning?” said the latter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p>“Aye, sir; we’ll be outside by ten o’clock.”</p>

<p>“And what will you take the three of us for?”</p>

<p>“Were you going by the steamer?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll do it for just what the steamer has to
allow you for your tickets—or, in other words, I’ll
take your tickets for the trip.”</p>

<p>“That is certainly very fair. Are you sure you can
dispose of the tickets?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a captain always can. An ordinary passenger
might have trouble, but we never do. Just give me
your tickets, and I’ll give you passes on my vessel for
the trip.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess”—began Mr. Whyland.</p>

<p>“How long will it take you to reach San Francisco?”
put in Oliver.</p>

<p>“About twenty days, if we have favorable weather.”</p>

<p>“I mean at the most.”</p>

<p>“Not over twenty-six days.”</p>

<p>The two boys and Mr. Whyland held a brief consultation.
At the conclusion they informed Captain
Morris that they had decided to accept his offer, and
the transfer of tickets was made on the spot.</p>

<p>“Mr. Willett, the purser, will show you to your
staterooms,” said Captain Morris after their business
was concluded. “There are two nice ones close together
that you will occupy, and he will make it
comfortable for ye.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Willett was called, and he at once led the way
below. They found everything as Captain Morris
had described it, and in less than an hour they felt
quite at home.</p>

<p>“This is a lucky thing for us in more ways than
one,” said Mr. Whyland to Oliver. “If Colonel
Mendix has discovered that we are on his track this
new move will throw him off. He will think we
are here in Panama waiting for the steamer while
we will be half-way to San Francisco.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” returned Oliver, “and I am glad
of it, although I guess he hasn’t the slightest idea
that I am after him.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could say the same. But I have a feeling
that that is not so in my case. He is an awfully
sharp fellow.”</p>

<p>“Let us trust he has overreached himself,” said
Oliver hopefully.</p>

<p>They took their evening meal at a small restaurant
in the town, and later on strolled along the all but
deserted battlements of the coast, and one or two of
the ancient looking streets, and around a tumbled-down
convent.</p>

<p>“Panama is almost a city of the past,” remarked
Mr. Whyland. “Its former glory seems to be gone
for good.”</p>

<p>At nine o’clock a boat came to the wharf to take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
them and Captain Morris and the first mate on board.
It was a fine moonlight evening; but as soon as they
reached the deck of the Polly Eliza they went below,
so heavy was the night dew.</p>

<p>Oliver, with Gus as a room-mate, slept soundly
that night. When he awoke the peculiar noise overhead
told him that the ship was getting underway.
He sprang up and aroused his companion.</p>

<p>“Don’t want to get up. Let me sleep,” mumbled
Gus.</p>

<p>“You’ve got to,” was all Oliver replied; and he
gave Gus a poke that started the stout youth at
once.</p>

<p>“Wonder you wouldn’t wake a fellow in the middle
of the night,” grumbled Gus, as he began slowly
to dress.</p>

<p>“Middle of the night? It’s seven o’clock, at least.”</p>

<p>“Well, what of it? You say it as if it meant ten.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come, Gus, hurry up. We want to see the
steamer leave Panama—at least I do.”</p>

<p>In five minutes more Oliver was on deck, and the
stout lad slowly followed him. They found that Mr.
Whyland was ahead of them.</p>

<p>“We are off,” said that gentleman. “We shall
not set foot on ground again until we land in San
Francisco.”</p>

<small>A STARTLING CRY.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Won’t we stop at any points in Mexico?” asked
Oliver.</p>

<p>“I think not. Captain Morris is anxious to make
the voyage as quickly as possible, for he thinks he
can get a good return cargo.”</p>

<p>“If we had the time to spare I wouldn’t like anything
better than to stop at La Libertad, Champerico,
and the rest of the towns,” continued Oliver;
“I love to see strange places.”</p>

<p>“I think most every one does,” returned Mr. Whyland.
“I have traveled for many years, and I never
tire of it. There is always something unexpected
turning up.”</p>

<p>“I like to keep moving,” put in Gus; “I hate to
stay too long in one place. Now, take a town like
Panama, for instance; a day or two is sufficient to
see all there is to be seen.”</p>

<p>“You are quite mistaken there,” replied Mr. Whyland.
“There are many ancient convents and historic
ruins there, which, if studied up, would prove
interesting for several weeks; that is, if you didn’t
have anything else on your mind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<p>The Polly Eliza was steaming down the bay
rapidly. In a couple of hours she had passed
the point. The day was a delightful one, and the
three spent the entire forenoon on deck.</p>

<p>“This used to be a very odd kind of a voyage
during the first years of the gold fever,” said Mr.
Whyland. “There were very few steamers, and the
sailing-vessels took from sixty to ninety days to
reach San Francisco.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t some people come by sailing-vessels all the
way around Cape Horn?” asked Gus.</p>

<p>“Yes; almost all the first people that did not go
overland came that way. It was a tedious journey.
The second vessel that made the trip took nine
months.”</p>

<p>“Nine months!” exclaimed Oliver. “Why, that is
three-quarters of a year.”</p>

<p>“When they reached the Golden Gate nearly half
of the passengers were sick with scurvy, and many
of them were buried up to their necks in the ground
to cure them.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t want to take any such trip as that,”
put in Gus. “I would get so sick of seeing nothing
but water and sky I wouldn’t know what to do.”</p>

<p>“It is no easy matter to double the Horn, as it
is called,” continued Mr. Whyland. “It took that
vessel nearly seven weeks to do it. Every time she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
was nearly around, the fierce trade winds from the
Pacific would drive her back.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad I didn’t have to go that way,” said
Gus with a grimace.</p>

<p>“So you see this voyage is really nothing,” laughed
Mr. Whyland.</p>

<p>During the afternoon it began to grow foggy,
and then the two boys went below and put their
stateroom in order.</p>

<p>This task was hardly completed before Gus began
to feel queer and drew down the corners of his mouth.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Oliver, although he
suspected the cause.</p>

<p>“I—I—am afraid I—I—” stammered the stout
youth.</p>

<p>“Seasick?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Better rest in the bunk for a while.”</p>

<p>“I guess I will.”</p>

<p>In half an hour poor Gus was as bad as ever.
Oliver did all for his chum that he could think of,
and even went to the purser for advice.</p>

<p>“Can’t do a thing,” replied Mr. Willett. “Perhaps
he may not be so bad as he was on the trip
around Cape Hatteras.”</p>

<p>“I trust not,” returned Oliver. “I haven’t been
seasick myself, but I imagine it’s something awful.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span></p>

<p>“It is,” responded the purser. “Get it real bad
and you won’t care whether you live or not. I have
followed the sea for twelve years, but once in a
while my stomach goes back on me even yet.”</p>

<p>“Why, I thought sailors never got sick!”</p>

<p>“That’s a big mistake. You may be a sailor all
your life and get it just as bad as if it were your
first voyage. You can thank your stars that you
are not one of the seasick kind.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I am lucky that way.”</p>

<p>Poor Gus lay in the cabin all that afternoon and
all night. In the morning he felt better, however,
and though rather weak, managed to eat a little
breakfast.</p>

<p>“Now I hope I’m over it for good,” he said. “If
I am not I’ll just jump overboard, that’s what I’ll
do.”</p>

<p>“And make food for the sharks,” laughed Mr.
Whyland. “Just look out there at the ferocious
fellows moving around. That one would just make
about three mouthfuls of you.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he pointed over the side to where an
ugly shovel-nose shark was swimming leisurely along.</p>

<p>“Ough!” shuddered Gus, drawing back. “I
didn’t see him.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he would think you were a good fat
morsel,” laughed Oliver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<p>There was a general smile, and then Mr. Whyland
pointed directly to the westward.</p>

<p>“That is the Island of Quibo, and far back of
it you can see the coast line of Central America.
We are getting along, true enough.”</p>

<p>That day and the next flew by rapidly. There
were many things on board the small coast steamer
that were new to the two boys, and as the purser
had taken a decided liking to them they gained much
information by “nosing around,” as Gus put it.</p>

<p>One evening they found themselves far out of
sight of land. All hands enjoyed a beautiful sunset,
and it was nearly eight o’clock when the little
party went below.</p>

<p>“Getting more used to it?” asked Mr. Whyland,
as they separated for the night after a quiet game
of dominoes in the cabin.</p>

<p>“Somewhat,” replied Oliver.</p>

<p>“I’m not,” said Gus. “I wish something real
exciting would happen. Something that would stir
up a fellow’s blood.”</p>

<p>“Are you anxious to be shipwrecked?” laughed
Mr. Whyland.</p>

<p>“No, not that exactly; but I hate to have things
so tame.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe something will happen,” was the
quiet reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>Little did Mr. Whyland realize how quickly his
thought would become a fact. Had he done so it
is not likely that he would have gone to his cabin
with such a tranquil heart.</p>

<p>When they reached their stateroom the two boys
sat for a long time discussing matters in general,
the principal question being what should each do
when the steamer reached San Francisco.</p>

<p>“You had better telegraph to your father, Gus. He
will be very anxious concerning your whereabouts.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do that, Oliver,” was the stout youth’s reply.
“I begin to see that running away wasn’t
such a brilliant thing to do after all.”</p>

<p>“Now you’ve hit the nail right on the head,”
replied Oliver; and he said no more.</p>

<p>Half an hour later both boys were in their berths
and sleeping soundly. How long they remained in
this state neither could tell exactly.</p>

<p>Suddenly Oliver awoke with a start. He jumped
out on the floor wondering what had aroused him.
Gus, too, was wide awake.</p>

<p>“Somebody hammered on the door,” cried the
stout youth. “Maybe—”</p>

<p>He did not finish, for at that instant a wild cry
came from the deck overhead.</p>

<p>“Fire! Fire! Fire!”</p>

<p>Both stared at each other with blanched faces.</p>

<small>OLIVER’S HEROISM.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It would be useless to deny the fact that Oliver
and Gus were thoroughly startled when they heard
the cry of fire that came from the deck of the Polly
Eliza.</p>

<p>They could easily realize the danger of their situation.
Out of sight of land, and in the darkness of
night, which way should they turn? What could
they do?</p>

<p>“Let us hurry on deck,” cried Oliver. “There is
not a moment to spare.”</p>

<p>There was no need to hurry Gus, for that youth
was already struggling to get into his clothing. By
the time Oliver was ready, Gus was also dressed. As
they rushed out and into the cabin, they met Mr.
Whyland. He was deadly pale.</p>

<p>“I was just going to call you,” he said. “I was
afraid you had not heard the cries.”</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” asked Oliver. “Where is
the fire?”</p>

<p>“In the forward hold. It started in some loose
waste that ought never to have been allowed there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>“Is it dangerous?” faltered Gus.</p>

<p>“I hope not; but we cannot tell. It is a hard
fire to get at.”</p>

<p>By this time the three were on deck. All was confusion.
The pump attached to the engine had been
brought into play, and the sailors were pouring the
water into the hold as well as they were able.</p>

<p>“Don’t be alarmed,” said Captain Morris, as calmly
as he could. “It may be all over in an hour. It
is a small fire.”</p>

<p>“But a nasty one, I take it,” put in the purser,
who stood near.</p>

<p>“Why don’t the men go below and try to locate
the flames?” asked Oliver, as he noted that no one
went below decks.</p>

<p>“Sailors have too much horror of fire,” responded
Mr. Whyland; “and Captain Morris’s place is here
on deck.”</p>

<p>“They might do a good deal more good by going
below,” put in Gus.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the fire began to spread towards the
stern. All the sailors began to shake their heads,
and several said it would be better to spend the
time in getting ready to leave the steamer.</p>

<p>“Leave the ship!” exclaimed Captain Morris.
“Leave the Polly Eliza! Not much! If I wasn’t
so old and asthmatic I’d go down into the hold
myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span></p>

<p>Oliver stood for a moment in meditation.</p>

<p>“Let me go down,” he said suddenly. “If somebody
don’t go the ship may burn up and we’ll all
go to the bottom. If I can’t do any good I’ll come
up at once.”</p>

<p>And without waiting for a reply, Oliver hurried
towards the partly closed hatchway.</p>

<p>There was a small step-ladder at hand, and getting
the sailors to help him put this down, Oliver took
a deep breath and quickly descended into the hold.</p>

<p>“There’s bravery for you!” exclaimed Captain
Morris. “I should think this would make some
of you feel mighty cheap,” he added to the men.</p>

<p>It was indeed a bold thing to do. The hold was
one mass of thick, stifling smoke, and breathing
down there was next to impossible.</p>

<p>As soon as Oliver reached the bottom he dropped
on his hands and knees. Dragging the nozzle of
the hose behind him, he crawled rapidly to the spot
where the flames arose.</p>

<p>A minute later and he was right beside the fire.
He saw that it was confined to some loose waste, as
Mr. Whyland had said, and also to half a dozen bales
of cloth stored close at hand.</p>

<p>By the time Oliver had made this discovery his
eyes were all but blinded, and his head swam as it
never had before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll fix this pipe fast so the water will pour right
on the fire,” he thought; “then there will be no
use in staying.”</p>

<p>After some little difficulty this was done. The
effects of the water pouring directly on the flames
told at once. But the smoke became thicker than
ever, and Oliver hurried to the hatchway.</p>

<p>As soon as he appeared in the opening he was
hauled out. He was so weak he could not stand.
He sank in a heap on a seat.</p>

<p>“I left the hose pouring water right on the fire,”
he gasped. “If somebody will go down you can
have the fire out in ten minutes.”</p>

<p>“I will go,” said Mr. Willett. “I will not be
outdone by a boy, even though he be as noble as
this lad.” And he disappeared down the hatchway.</p>

<p>Anxiously those on deck waited for him to reappear.
At the end of five minutes he did so.</p>

<p>“It is about out,” he reported. “The hose has
soaked everything, and there is no more danger.
The smoke that is coming up doesn’t amount to
anything.”</p>

<p>“Thank God it is so!” exclaimed Mr. Whyland;
and everybody near echoed the sentiment.</p>

<p>“Our safety is due to this young man,” said
Captain Morris, grasping Oliver by the shoulder.
“You deserve a medal for your bravery.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span></p>

<p>At this Oliver was compelled to blush. But he
blushed even more when a cheer, led by Gus, was
taken up by all hands.</p>

<p>“I didn’t do so much,” he said.</p>

<p>“You did enough,” rejoined Mr. Whyland. “What
more could be wanted than that?”</p>

<p>“I shall never forget the service,” put in the
captain heartily; “I don’t know what I would
have done had the Polly Eliza been burned. She
has been my home for so many years.”</p>

<p>A little later a number of the sailors went below,
and under directions from the purser, made a thorough
search of the hold. It was thought every spark of
fire had been extinguished; but to make doubly sure
two of the men were told to remain on guard for
the balance of the night and all the next day.</p>

<p>“Then I suppose we might as well go to bed
again,” said Gus who, now that the excitement
was over, began to feel sleepy.</p>

<p>“Yes; there is no further danger,” returned Captain
Morris. “To-morrow I will hold a strict investigation
as to the cause of the fire. If I find any
of the men are to blame, they shall pay the penalty,
I can tell you.”</p>

<p>Mr. Whyland went below, and Oliver followed Gus
to their stateroom. Both undressed and turned in,
but it was nearly daylight before either of them
dropped asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<p>Oliver was the first to awaken. He turned to his
friend and found the stout youth tossing and mumbling
uneasily to himself.</p>

<p>“Fire! Save me! save me!” mumbled Gus.</p>

<p>Oliver gave him a vigorous shaking, and the stout
youth sat up and rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p>“Where—where?” he stammered. “Thank goodness
it was only a dream! I thought I was down
in the hole, burning up.”</p>

<p>“Well, you were wishing for an adventure and
you got one,” laughed Oliver. “Want any more of
them?”</p>

<p>“Not just for the present,” replied Gus with a
shiver. “Suppose you and the rest hadn’t put out
the fire, what then?”</p>

<p>“It would have been bad enough, and no mistake,”
replied Oliver.</p>

<p>At the breakfast-table Captain Morris again thanked
Oliver for what he had done. He said he had found
out that the fire had been caused by friction amongst
the cargo, and that no one in particular was to blame.</p>

<p>During the day, the sailors busied themselves in
throwing out all the burned matter and in rearranging
the cargo, so that a repetition of the affair
might not occur.</p>

<p>Oliver and Gus watched the operation for a while,
and then turned their attention to the sea where countless
sharks loomed up in all directions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>“The water here is generally full of them,” said
Mr. Whyland. “I have spent a day or two fishing
for them.”</p>

<p>“Fishing for them?” repeated Oliver in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I thought you had to spear them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; you can catch them with a hook and
line provided both be strong enough.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to try the sport,” said Gus.</p>

<p>“We will do so to-morrow if Captain Morris will
lend us a hook and line. He is too busy to be bothered
now.”</p>

<p>The answer did not quite suit Gus. Having heard
of shark fishing, he was anxious to try it at once. A
little later he procured a large hook and a stout line
from the purser, and some meat from the cook, and
began to fish on his own account.</p>

<p>At this time Oliver was in deep conversation with
Mr. Whyland. They were speaking of the Aurora
mine, and did not notice what Gus was doing.</p>

<p>Suddenly came a sharp cry for help. Gus had
caught a shark and was unable to hold the ugly monster.
The two made a dash for the rail; but before
they could reach the boy’s side the line tightened, and
with a wild cry Gus slid overboard.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<small>GUS HAS AN ADVENTURE.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The accident that had happened to the stout youth
was easily explained. In order to make sure that the
line should not slip through his hands, Gus had very
foolishly tied it about his wrist; and when it became
evident that he could not haul in the shark, he found
that neither could he loosen the line, which was now
pulled into a hard knot.</p>

<p>He then braced himself against the rail and raised
the cry for help heard by the others. But the strain
on his arm was terrible, and when the shark gave
an extra heavy tug, Gus went overboard in a twinkling.</p>

<p>The tension on the rope carried him fully fifteen
feet from the steamer. He struck the water with a
loud splash, and then disappeared beneath the surface.</p>

<p>“Man overboard!” cried Oliver. “Good heavens!
what shall we do?”</p>

<p>“Man the boat!” sang out Captain Morris, who
saw at a glance what had taken place. “Quick, boys!
Sharks are thick here!”</p>

<p>These last words carried terror to Oliver’s heart.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
They could bear but one meaning, and that was that
poor Gus was in danger of being devoured.</p>

<p>“What can we do?” he asked, appealing to Mr.
Whyland.</p>

<p>“Not much. They are getting the boat out as
fast as they can. Your friend was very foolish to
tie that line fast to his wrist.”</p>

<p>“See! see! the shark is making for him!” cried
Oliver in a strained voice. “What can we do?
Oh, Mr. Whyland!”</p>

<p>“We can do nothing. Heaven grant they reach
the poor boy in time. But—but—I fear not!”
And the gentleman turned away to hide his emotion.</p>

<p>Oliver glanced around. It was terrible to be so
helpless. He and Gus were the closest of friends.
He could never let his chum perish without trying
to save him. He ought to do something—he would
do something!</p>

<p>He looked along the deck, and his gaze fell upon
a short but stout knife that the sailors had used in
cutting away some of the half-burned bales of cloth.
He picked up the knife, and taking it between his
teeth, stripped off his coat.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked Mr. Whyland,
hurrying towards him.</p>

<p>“See if I cannot help him,” was Oliver’s determined
reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span></p>

<p>“But the peril—”</p>

<p>“I would never forgive myself if Gus perished
and I did not do a thing to save him.”</p>

<p>And <a href="#i_frontis">before the other could interfere, Oliver was
on the rail and over the side</a>.</p>

<p>“The bravery of one boy in a thousand,” murmured
Mr. Whyland to himself. “I would give half
I possess to have such a son!”</p>

<p>Oliver had made a careful calculation before he
left the rail, and when he rose to the surface of
the water he was not over two yards away from
Gus. He struck out at once, and in an instant
was beside his friend.</p>

<p>“Oliver! Save me!”</p>

<p>“Is the rope fast to your wrist?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Let me cut it.”</p>

<p>Gus held up his arm, and the next moment the
cord was severed.</p>

<p>“Now strike out for the steamer,” said Oliver.
“The shark is after you!”</p>

<p>And side by side they struck out.</p>

<p>But the shark was already close at hand. Try
their best, they could not get away from him. Gus
gave a piercing shriek.</p>

<p>“He is after my foot!”</p>

<p>“Dive!” called out Oliver; and he set the example.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>Gus followed. When they rose again, the shark was
but a few feet away. They could see him getting
ready to turn over, preparatory to opening his jaws
for a snap at either one or the other.</p>

<p>The monster turned toward Gus. The stout youth
gave another cry of terror.</p>

<p>“Help! Help!”</p>

<p>Then Oliver thought of the knife still in his hand.
Grasping the handle of the weapon firmly, he swam up,
and buried the blade deeply in the shark’s head.</p>

<p>There was a wild slashing of the monster’s tail, and
the water was dyed crimson. A moment later the boat
appeared, and Gus was hauled in.</p>

<p>Then the shark turned his attention to Oliver. But
the boy struck out firmly with the knife, once, twice,
three times; and then the shark turned over and floated
off—dead.</p>

<p>“The bravest deed I ever saw!” cried Mr. Willett,
as they helped Oliver into the boat. “After this
don’t dare to tell me the age of heroes is gone by.”</p>

<p>“Can we get that shark?” panted Oliver. “I—I
would like to keep some part of the fellow as a remembrance
of this event.”</p>

<p>“We’ll haul him on board,” said Mr. Willett. And
later on this was done.</p>

<p>When they turned their attention to Gus they found
that he had fainted. It took fully a quarter of an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
hour’s work to restore him to consciousness, and even
then he was so weak from the terror of what had occurred
that he had to lie down for the remainder of the
day.</p>

<p>Now that it was all over, Oliver, too, felt rather shaky
in the legs. However, he watched the men get the
shark aboard, and then spent some time in examining
the monster.</p>

<p>“As large a shovel-nose as I have ever seen,” said
Captain Morris. “It’s a wonder that he didn’t make
mince-meat of both of you.”</p>

<p>The boy selected some of the teeth, and after they
were broken out of the jaw-bone, the carcass was sent
to the galley to be tried out.</p>

<p>“I guess we won’t want to go shark fishing after
this,” said Mr. Whyland.</p>

<p>“No,” rejoined Oliver with a shiver; “I don’t
even want to see another of the ugly things!”</p>

<p>“They are awfully dangerous creatures,” went on
Mr. Whyland. “Many a one-legged sailor has had the
missing limb taken off by just such a fellow as this.”</p>

<p>“And many a sailor has had his head taken off
instead of his leg,” put in Captain Morris. “I
wouldn’t do what you did for a thousand dollars!”</p>

<p>“Neither would I again,” replied Oliver; “but I
think too much of Gus to let him become food for
sharks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<p>After this they separated, and Oliver went down
to the stateroom. No sooner did he enter than Gus
threw his arms about his chum’s neck.</p>

<p>“Oh, Olly! how can I thank you?” he cried.
“You saved my life!” And the tears streamed down
his cheeks.</p>

<p>“Don’t try to do it, Gus. I know you would
have done as much for me if it was necessary.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. You are awfully brave. I’ll never
forget it as long as I live!”</p>

<p>“I guess you’ve had enough adventures on this
trip,” said Oliver. He found his own eyes growing
moist, and he thought best to turn the matter into a
laugh.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed! I sha’n’t attempt another thing
while I am on board.”</p>

<p>On the following day the steamer sighted Mazatlan.
The course of the Polly Eliza was now directly
across the bay of Lower California.</p>

<p>“We shall soon be in sight of Cape St. Lucas,”
said Captain Morris; “and unless something happens
we’ll soon reach the Golden Gate.”</p>

<p>Fortunately the weather remained fine, and the little
party was thus enabled to spend the days on deck.
Much about the little coast steamer pleased the boys,
and Captain Morris and the others made every effort
to have the time pass pleasantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<p>“It won’t be long afore we part,” he said to Oliver.
“I trust we may meet again some day; but if we
don’t you can make up your mind that I’ll never
forget what you did towards saving the Polly Eliza
from destruction.”</p>

<p>“Will you remain long in San Francisco?” asked
Oliver.</p>

<p>“Only long enough to get my cargo. But if I can
be of service to you I’ll stay a week,” added the captain
quickly.</p>

<p>“I only wanted to know where the mining boards
and stock companies are located.”</p>

<p>“Most of them are on Montgomery and Pine Streets.
You’ll find them in the directory.”</p>

<p>“Then that’s all I want to know for the present.”</p>

<p>The time seemed to drag now, so impatient were the
boys to set foot on shore. Mr. Whyland could not
help but smile at both of them, though he himself was
also very eager to have the voyage over.</p>

<p>But all journeys must come to an end, and one fine
morning the Polly Eliza dropped anchor just outside
of one of the many wharves.</p>

<p>Then the boat took them and Mr. Whyland ashore.
They were not long in scrambling up the dock.</p>

<p>“San Francisco at last!” cried Oliver.</p>

<small>A FLYING GLANCE.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Yes, San Francisco at last,” repeated Gus and Mr.
Whyland; and the latter added, “Now, the question is,
what is it best to do first?”</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll find out quick enough,” said Oliver.
“Let us take a look about the city and see if we can
find out if Colonel Mendix has arrived.”</p>

<p>“Of course he has arrived; that is, unless he stopped
on the way.”</p>

<p>“That is just what I mean. He may have stopped
in Chicago or St. Louis for that machinery he wished
to purchase.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it would be a bad plan to look over
the registers at the various hotels.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” replied Oliver. “We can do
that this morning.”</p>

<p>“I know what I am going to do,” said Gus. “I’m
going to the post-office and see if my father has
written to me.”</p>

<p>“Let’s all go,” burst out Oliver. “I am as anxious
to hear from home as any one.”</p>

<p>“And so am I,” laughed Mr. Whyland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>They had landed near the foot of Brannan Street,
and now walked up to Kearney Street. A policeman
directed them to the post-office, and it did not
take the party long to reach the place.</p>

<p>There were letters for all three. How eagerly
Oliver cut open the envelope and read that which
had been penned by his father! This was what he
wrote:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I trust that when you receive this you will have had a
safe journey. I suppose you found the trip a tedious one, not
because it is devoid of interest, but because you were undoubtedly
anxious to reach its end and begin the active part
of your quest.</p>

<p>“I received your letter containing the particulars of what
occurred in New York. I believe you are able to go ahead
without my advice, and all I have to say is, be careful; for
I am now sure that Colonel Mendix is a thoroughly bad man,
and may get desperate if brought to bay.</p>

<p>“I inclose you an express money-order for one hundred
dollars. Use it as you think best. I know you will not do
so recklessly.</p>

<p>“I suppose that Gregory boy is with you. If he is, see
that he does not get into trouble. His parents are much
worried about him.</p>

<p>“I am getting well rapidly, and expect to be about before
long. In the meanwhile I trust you will keep me posted on
what you are doing, as I am getting more anxious every day.
Write as soon as you receive this.”</p>
</div>

<p>Such was the gist of the affectionate father’s epistle.
But there was much besides,—kind, loving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
words that need not be repeated here, but which,
nevertheless, went straight to Oliver’s heart.</p>

<p>“I’ll write him a letter at once,” he thought;
and buying stamps and paper, did so, stating that a
long letter would follow almost immediately.</p>

<p>Gus Gregory’s face lengthened considerably when
he read the letter his father had written to him. It
was kind, but firm, and told how much all at home
had suffered on account of his unexpected departure.
When Gus read how his mother had wept over his
foolish act, his own eyes grew dim, and he half wished
himself back at Rockvale.</p>

<p>But the latter end of the letter was more cheerful.
Mr. Gregory had intended, during the summer following,
to let his son take a trip to Europe before settling
down to college work. Now, instead, he wrote
that Gus might spend the present time in California,
and give up the trip across the ocean.</p>

<p>He also inclosed a money-order for fifty dollars,
and said that more might follow when he heard what
his son was doing. He also hoped that Gus was with
Oliver and that they would stay together, for he knew
that Oliver was a manly fellow and one to be trusted.</p>

<p>Oliver blushed when Gus showed him this part of
the letter.</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense,” he exclaimed; “you are big
enough to take care of yourself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<p>“No, I am not, as that adventure with the shark
proves,” replied the stout youth. “Just wait till I
write to them about that.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you will make it as sensational as you
can, and put me in as a regular dime-novel hero,”
laughed Oliver; and he blushed more than ever.</p>

<p>Mr. Whyland’s letter was from his business partners,
and told him that everything in the East was
running smoothly. This news brought great relief
to him, and he said that now he would be able to
bend all his energies to hunting down Colonel Mendix
and the Aurora mine swindle.</p>

<p>“I think we had better attend to our money-orders
first,” suggested Oliver.</p>

<p>This was agreed to, and they started out at once.
Being strangers, they had some difficulty in getting
the orders cashed; but finally this was accomplished,
and the two boys emerged upon the streets richer
than before.</p>

<p>“Now that father has written that I can stay in
California for a while, I intend to unite my fortunes
with you,” said Gus; “that is, if you will allow
me to do so.”</p>

<p>“I am perfectly willing, if you wish it,” replied
Oliver; “but I do not know about Mr. Whyland.”</p>

<p>“I shall be pleased to have Mr. Gregory along if
he wishes to come,” said that gentleman. “But you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
must remember we may have some pretty rough experiences
before we accomplish what we have set out
to do,” he added seriously.</p>

<p>“I am willing to put up with whatever comes, sir.”</p>

<p>“The West is not the East in more ways than
one,” continued Mr. Whyland. “Many things are
mighty rough here, especially when you get up in
the mountains.”</p>

<p>From the express-office they started for the nearest
hotel, where they looked carefully over the register;
but looked in vain.</p>

<p>“Failure number one,” said Oliver. “I suppose
we may have a number of them before we are lucky
enough to strike the right house.”</p>

<p>“It would be funny if we ran across this Mendix
the first thing,” said Gus. “My, wouldn’t he be
surprised!”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t know me, I believe,” said Oliver.</p>

<p>“And that is where you have an advantage,” put
in Mr. Whyland. “Perhaps you can get into his
good graces, and learn much before you make yourself
known.”</p>

<p>“That is certainly an idea,” returned Oliver.</p>

<p>From the first hotel they went to a number of
others, but nowhere could a trace of the colonel be
found.</p>

<p>“I have half an idea he uses a false name while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
here,” suggested Oliver. “A man like him would
not hesitate at anything.”</p>

<p>“It may be so. If it is, there is no use in searching
further. Suppose we go around to some of the
mining stock brokers or to the exchange? We may
find out about him there. We will certainly discover
something of the Aurora mine.”</p>

<p>This was agreed to, and the remainder of the forenoon
was spent down in Pine and Montgomery Streets.
They entered a great number of offices, but no one
had heard of the Aurora mine, nor did any one know
such a person as Colonel Mendix.</p>

<p>“This completely baffles me,” said Mr. Whyland
at last. “I was sure the mine would be known
here. How can he work it if it is not known?
Such a place must give employment to scores of
men. It is a great mystery.”</p>

<p>“We <em>must</em> find out about it,” replied Oliver with
determination. “I sha’n’t give up in this fashion. If
I can’t find him by his name I’ll see if there isn’t
some one who knows him from his appearance.”</p>

<p>“Good! I like such grit!” cried Mr. Whyland.
“If your determination has anything to do with it
we shall certainly win.”</p>

<p>They were out on the street once more. Oliver
had the address of a large hotel on Market Street,
and this place he said he would visit and examine
the register.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>

<p>“It won’t take a great deal of time,” he said
“and I don’t want a single chance to slip of bringing
him to justice.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” put in Gus. “Do the work thoroughly
while you are about it.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Mr. Whyland gave a cry and pointed
to a cable-car that was just then passing.</p>

<p>“See, it is Mendix himself!” he exclaimed, indicating
a man on the rear platform.</p>

<p>Oliver looked, and saw that he was right.</p>

<small>AN UNSUCCESSFUL PURSUIT.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Oliver Bright, as may be imagined, was astonished
when Mr. Whyland discovered the very man
they were looking for, standing calmly on the rear
end of a passing cable-car.</p>

<p>For an instant he doubted the evidence of his own
eyesight, but a second look told him that in truth
it was the colonel.</p>

<p>For a moment he stood still. Then he started
forward to stop the car.</p>

<p>But those in charge did not see him and the cable-car
went bounding on its way with Oliver after it.</p>

<p>Mr. Whyland and Gus started to run also, but soon
gave up the chase.</p>

<p>“I am getting too old for that sort of thing,” gasped
the former, as he leaned against a building, all out
of breath.</p>

<p>“And I get winded too easily,” groaned the stout
youth. “Oliver must catch the fellow alone.”</p>

<p>“I hope he will succeed. We may not get another
such chance.” And then they both started on
a walk in the direction in which the car had gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the car kept moving at a rapid rate,
with the boy nearly a block behind it. Sometimes
Oliver would get nearer, but then he would lose
time at some crossing and the distance would be
increased.</p>

<p>Finally, at the end of eight or ten blocks, he
managed to come up to the car, and as it stopped,
he sprang on board.</p>

<p>He gave a hasty look around. Colonel Mendix
had disappeared.</p>

<p>Oliver was deeply chagrined. Was it possible that
he had made a mistake in the car?</p>

<p>“It looks like the same car,” he thought; “but then
they all look alike.”</p>

<p>Presently the conductor came to him, and Oliver
asked him if a Spanish gentleman had been aboard.</p>

<p>“What kind of a looking man?”</p>

<p>Oliver described Colonel Mendix as best he could.</p>

<p>“Yes, he was on; got off two or three blocks
back; maybe four,” was the conductor’s reply.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” replied Oliver; and he hopped off
the car and started to retrace his steps.</p>

<p>“Too bad he couldn’t have remained on the car
a minute longer,” he muttered to himself. “I suppose
he has disappeared into some building or down
some side street by this time. I’ll go back and
take a look around.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span></p>

<p>He had proceeded about three blocks when he
came face to face with the others.</p>

<p>“What luck?” cried Mr. Whyland.</p>

<p>Oliver told him.</p>

<p>“Too bad, after such a splendid chance.”</p>

<p>“I’d keep a sharp lookout for him along here,”
put in Gus; “he can’t be far off.”</p>

<p>“I have a plan,” returned Oliver. “Let us separate,
and each watch several squares. By doing that
we can cover nearly all the ground necessary.”</p>

<p>“A good idea,” cried Mr. Whyland. “We will
carry it out at once.”</p>

<p>“And where shall we meet again?” asked Gus.</p>

<p>“In front of this large building,” said Oliver, “at
one o’clock.”</p>

<p>They immediately separated, and each proceeded
to watch in his own way. Oliver peered into every
store and office, and down every street, but without
success. At the end of the time appointed he went
back to the designated meeting-place.</p>

<p>Mr. Whyland was already there.</p>

<p>Neither had had any luck.</p>

<p>In five minutes Gus arrived.</p>

<p>“I thought I saw him,” he said. “I tried to follow,
but at the end of the block I found I was
mistaken.”</p>

<p>“So we are now no further ahead than we ever
were,” remarked Oliver, somewhat bitterly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p>“Never mind; we won’t despair,” replied Mr.
Whyland. “Remember, we have not been a whole
day at the hunt.”</p>

<p>“I’m not despairing; but the sooner we find this
man the better.”</p>

<p>All three were now, not only tired out, but tremendously
hungry. Mr. Whyland led the way to a
neighboring restaurant, and here they indulged in
a substantial dinner.</p>

<p>“Now, what next?” asked Gus.</p>

<p>“I’m going around to that hotel, and then the
mining board again,” said Oliver. “I shall look
for him by appearance, not by name now.”</p>

<p>In this quest Oliver decided to go alone. If the
three were together they might excite suspicion.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll go back to the hotel where we left
our baggage,” said Mr. Whyland.</p>

<p>“And I’ll go and send a telegram to my father,”
put in Gus. “I suppose he’ll be awfully anxious
about me until he hears that I am safe.”</p>

<p>This was agreed to, and in a moment more Oliver
was on his way to Montgomery Street.</p>

<p>“You say the man you are looking for is a tall,
dark Spaniard?” inquired one of the gentleman to
whom he applied.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I thought his name was Mendix.” And
Oliver described the colonel as fully as was possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<p>“I think you mean Colonel Guerotaz,” said the
man in charge of the office. “He is interested in
several mining schemes, I believe, all up the Mokelumne
River.”</p>

<p>“And where can I find this Colonel Guerotaz?”
asked the boy with deep interest.</p>

<p>“I do not know. He was in here several times
during the earlier part of the week. I believe he
is getting ready to go up the country just as soon
as he can get some machinery shipped.”</p>

<p>This last statement made Oliver feel certain that
the two colonels were the same person. Colonel
Mendix had asked Ezra Dodge where he could purchase
the machinery he wanted, and that person had
informed him he could get it in San Francisco.</p>

<p>“And you do not know anything of the Aurora
mine?” went on Oliver.</p>

<p>“I do not. There was an Aurora mine somewhere
up the Sacramento River, and another elsewhere; but
both of them were abandoned years ago.”</p>

<p>Oliver’s heart sank for a moment.</p>

<p>“You do not know where the Aurora mine was
situated?” he faltered.</p>

<p>“I don’t remember exactly. But I am quite sure
it was not up the Mokelumne.”</p>

<p>“Then neither of them can be the one I am looking
for,” returned the boy, with something of a sigh
of relief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>“Are you interested in the mine?” asked the
man kindly.</p>

<p>“My father is. Do you know the names of the
mines that this Colonel Guerotaz is interested in?”</p>

<p>“The Excelsior is the principal one, I believe.
Then there is the Cortez; but I do not know much
about that, nor does any one else.”</p>

<p>“And they are both up the Mokelumne River?”</p>

<p>“Yes; you’ll find them on the mining-map.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p>Oliver quitted the office in deep thought. Of
one thing he was certain,—Colonel Mendix and
Colonel Guerotaz were one and the same person.
Now, could it be possible that the Cortez and the
Aurora were one and the same mine?</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” he thought, “about the only
way he could commit such a piece of villainy would
be to change the name of the mine. If he didn’t
do that any one could easily visit the place and
find out its value. I begin to understand how poor,
trusting father was duped.”</p>

<p>While Oliver had been in the office on Montgomery
Street he had not noticed a tall, lank fellow
lounging about the door. This man had been
deeply interested in the boy’s inquiries, and when
Oliver left the place the man was not slow to follow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<p>At the corner he stepped up and tapped Oliver on
the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” he said in a low voice; “but I
would like to have a few words with you on the
quiet.”</p>

<p>Oliver surveyed the man from head to foot.</p>

<p>“What is it you want?” he asked rather shortly,
for he had never seen the fellow before.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I hear you say something about the Aurora
mine?” asked the man.</p>

<p>“You did,” replied Oliver with sudden interest.
“What of it?”</p>

<p>“I know all about that mine,” was the slow reply.</p>

<p>“You do?” cried the boy. “Who are you?”</p>

<p>“My name is Felix Cottle. I used to be a mining
boss. I worked for Colonel Guerotaz for two
years. Then we had a terrible row, and he kicked
me out; but I know a good many of his secrets.”</p>

<p>“Then, perhaps you are just the man I want to
see,” replied Oliver.</p>

<p>“And you are just the party I want to meet,”
said Felix Cottle. “By your manner, I take it you
have it in for this Spaniard, and I would do ’most
anything to get square with him. What do you
want to know, and what is it worth to you?”</p>

<small>FELIX COTTLE.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Oliver looked the stranger over well before replying.
Perhaps this chap might be a tool of Colonel
Mendix, in which case the less he had to do
with the fellow the better.</p>

<p>“And you worked for Colonel Men—Guerotaz
two years?” he asked slowly.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“At what mine?”</p>

<p>The man closed one eye and winked knowingly.</p>

<p>“At the very mine you are looking for,” he replied.</p>

<p>“The Aurora?”</p>

<p>“That’s it, partner.”</p>

<p>“Then you know its exact location?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“What is the mine called?”</p>

<p>The man hesitated and rubbed his chin.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what it is, stranger,” he replied slowly;
“since I came from the mines I’ve had mighty tough
luck in ’Frisco, and I’m rather hard up. Make it
worth a little to me, and I’ll give you all the information
you wish.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p>“You mean you wish pay for telling what you
know of the place?”</p>

<p>“Well, not that exactly, only a little something
to help me along. I’ve been out of a job for over
two months.”</p>

<p>Oliver thought for a moment.</p>

<p>“Suppose you come along with me,” he said. “I
have a friend staying at a hotel close by. He must
hear what you have to say as well as I. I will pay
you for your trouble.”</p>

<p>“This is a square deal?”</p>

<p>“Yes. If you have any real information I will
pay whatever it is worth.”</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll go.”</p>

<p>Oliver at once led the way to the hotel at which
they had left their traps. He found Mr. Whyland
in the reading-room, looking over a copy of the
<cite>Call</cite>.</p>

<p>He quickly acquainted the gentleman with what had
taken place. Mr. Whyland was deeply interested.</p>

<p>“I guess you are right about the two colonels
being the same person,” he said. “Let us interview
this stranger at once. I am willing to pay him
if he really knows anything of value.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, Felix Cottle was at once brought in.
He wore a rough suit and big boots, and looked quite
out of place in the well-furnished apartment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<p>“I am more at home in the mountains than here,”
he remarked, as he took a chair beside them. “I
was brought up on the streets of Little Rock when
a boy; but I would rather travel a lonely trail any
day than walk the pavements of a city.”</p>

<p>“You know the mining district well, I suppose?”
said Mr. Whyland.</p>

<p>“There ain’t much of it that I don’t know,” replied
Cottle. “Before I started to work for Guerotaz
I spent twelve years and ten thousand dollars prospecting,
here, there, and everywhere.”</p>

<p>“Did you have any luck?” asked Oliver.</p>

<p>He was interested in the man, and besides wanted
a chance to study the stranger.</p>

<p>“I had some luck the first years,—located the Alice
and sold her for fifteen thousand dollars,—but towards
the last I lost every dollar I had, and then I went to
work for the colonel.”</p>

<p>“And you know all about his affairs?” asked Mr.
Whyland.</p>

<p>The man ran his hand through his matted hair.</p>

<p>“I don’t know you, and I don’t want to get into
any trouble,” he said. “I told the young man I knew
some things he wanted to know.”</p>

<p>“Well, you will get into no trouble with us, I can
assure you,” replied Mr. Whyland. “If you know
the location of the Aurora mine and will tell us, I
will pay you well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<p>“I can take you straight to the Aurora inside of
a week,” replied Cottle in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Is it a valuable mine?”</p>

<p>“It was some time ago.”</p>

<p>“Then that is the mine you worked in?” said
Oliver.</p>

<p>The man bit his lip.</p>

<p>“I didn’t say so,” he said.</p>

<p>“But you meant it,” put in Mr. Whyland. “Are
not the Cortez and the Aurora one and the same
mine?”</p>

<p>Felix Cottle started.</p>

<p>“You want to know everything without paying a
cent!” he cried. “I guess I had better get out.”</p>

<p>“No, don’t go,” exclaimed Mr. Whyland, catching
him by the arm. “I will pay you well. We want to
get to the Aurora mine. You say you know the
road—”</p>

<p>“Yes; I’ll take you there as straight as straight can
be. There ain’t a better guide in the town of ’Frisco,
if I do say it myself.”</p>

<p>“I suppose we’ll need a guide—” began Oliver.</p>

<p>“If you don’t think so, just start out without one,”
laughed Felix Cottle in his peculiar voice. “I’ll bet
you couldn’t find the mine even if you had full directions.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<p>“Because of its peculiar situation. Many a man
has been fooled on it.”</p>

<p>“And you say you can take us there in a week?”
asked Mr. Whyland.</p>

<p>“I can, on horseback or muleback.”</p>

<p>“And prove to us beyond a doubt that it is really
the Aurora?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and that it is run by Colonel Men—”</p>

<p>Cottle stopped short. Oliver took him up.</p>

<p>“Colonel Mendix.” He finished.</p>

<p>“Yes; if you must know. But, gents, I expect
you to do the square thing to a fellow that is down
on his luck.”</p>

<p>“We will do the square thing,” said Mr. Whyland.
“Take us to the Aurora mine and I will pay all expenses
and give you one hundred dollars for your
trouble.”</p>

<p>“Is that square?” asked Cottle, leaning forward.</p>

<p>“It is. If you want any references as to my reliability—”</p>

<p>“Don’t want them, partner; the look on your face
is enough. I’ll take you up. A week from the day
you leave ’Frisco you shall stand in the Aurora mine.
I may be a little queer, but you can depend on Felix
Cottle every time.”</p>

<p>Oliver had to like the man in spite of his odd
manner. Mr. Whyland was also impressed favorably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span></p>

<p>After this a long conversation ensued. Cottle said
that the Cortez mine was nothing but a “fake” mine,
leading underground to the real mine of value, which
was the Aurora. For several years Colonel Mendix
had reported the latter mine abandoned, which was
not the case.</p>

<p>“And the Aurora is really valuable?” asked
Oliver.</p>

<p>He spoke calmly enough, but oh, what excitement
was in his breast! How much was at stake for his
father and himself!</p>

<p>“I think it is,” said Cottle. “Of course the Cortez
is worth something, but the best paying rock and dirt
come from the Aurora.”</p>

<p>It was decided to leave San Francisco that very
evening. They were to go direct to Sacramento City,
and from there fit themselves out for a five days’
journey over and around the mountains.</p>

<p>When Gus came in, he was surprised to see the
stranger. He was at once introduced, and was soon
on good terms with the newly hired guide.</p>

<p>Cottle remained with them for the balance of the
afternoon. When questioned as to Colonel Mendix,
he said he thought the colonel would soon be on the
way to the mines.</p>

<p>“And we will be directly behind,” he added.
“Perhaps we may even catch up to him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span></p>

<p>“I do not wish to do that,” said Oliver. “It is
time enough to meet him when we are at the mine.”</p>

<p>The party of three spent the night at the hotel.
Oliver had a long talk with Mr. Whyland, promising
to share whatever expense was incurred. The gentleman
agreed to do this, but said the hundred dollars
that had been promised to Cottle must come from
his own purse.</p>

<small>OFF FOR THE MINES.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“What grand scenery this is!”</p>

<p>It was Oliver who uttered the exclamation. He
rode beside Mr. Whyland, while Gus Gregory was
directly behind. Cottle, the guide, was but a short
distance ahead.</p>

<p>For six hours the little party had been journeying
directly for the mountains far back of Sacramento City.
The road for the present was a well-defined one, but
Cottle said that before sundown it would become little
better than a wagon-track.</p>

<p>“It will be as nice a road as any one wants to
travel in a few years, I take it,” he added; “but I
remember the time when there wasn’t even a respectable
wagon-track. Times change rapidly out here.”</p>

<p>“One would hardly think that a handful of years
ago this was little more than a wilderness,” said Mr.
Whyland; “yet such is a fact. The earlier gold-hunters
were indeed pioneers.”</p>

<p>“I wish I had been one of them,” put in Gus.
“What excitement it must have been, expecting
that every day would bring fortune!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>“It was exciting; but many a man would have
done better to have remained at home.”</p>

<p>“You’re right there,” said Cottle. “I knew men
that got reckless in the fever and never amounted
to shucks after they came away. I’ve had my fill
of it; and if I had my life to lead over again I
think I would steer clear of prospecting.”</p>

<p>The three were now on good terms with the guide.
They found him a rather peculiar individual, but
thoroughly honest and obliging. He spent most of
the day in describing the country through which
they were passing, and Oliver never tired of listening
to his words.</p>

<p>Yet the boy’s mind was busy with other things.
In what condition would they find the Aurora mine?
and what would Colonel Mendix say when they
appeared so unexpectedly upon the scene?</p>

<p>He could well imagine the Spaniard’s surprise.
No doubt the man would do all in his power to
ward off their advances. He might even deny all
their rights to the mine. A man who had acted
as the colonel had would not hesitate at anything.</p>

<p>Towards sundown they made camp in a little grove
of trees to one side of the road. To Oliver and
Gus the proceedings were novel, for in all their
lives they had never passed a night in the open.</p>

<p>The mules were tethered a short distance away,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
a fire was started, a pot of water was set boiling
for the purpose of making coffee, and from out of
the various packs the boys and Mr. Whyland took
such articles as they wished for the evening meal.</p>

<p>“To-morrow we will be getting more into a game
country,” said Cottle, as they sat down to eat,
“and then maybe I’ll show you one or two good
things to shoot. Can any of you handle a rifle?”</p>

<p>“I can shoot some,” replied Gus.</p>

<p>“I have often gone gunning in the woods back
of Rockvale,” replied Oliver; “but I never tried my
hand at any big game.”</p>

<p>“We had better leave the big game alone,” laughed
Cottle. “As I understand it we are not on a hunting
tour, and it would take too much time.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” said Mr. Whyland with a smile;
“we are after game of a different sort.”</p>

<p>There was a general laugh, and then Gus observed,—</p>

<p>“But I would like to have a shy at a bear or
something.”</p>

<p>“Better leave bears alone,” put in Cottle with
a shudder. “I went after one once and it nearly
cost me my life.”</p>

<p>By the time the meal was finished the sun had
set, and then it grew dark rapidly; while the dew
became so heavy that Oliver wrapped a blanket about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
him to keep out the cold, and they all gathered
together under a big tree.</p>

<p>Cottle arranged a temporary tent by throwing a
double blanket over one of the lower boughs of
the tree. He said this would be ample shelter so
long as it did not rain. Then some dry boughs
were strewn upon the ground, and he invited all
hands to turn in as soon as it pleased them to do so.</p>

<p>It may well be imagined that Oliver slept but
little that night. The novelty of the situation, as
well as the strange sounds around him, kept him
awake until far into the small hours of the morning.
He was the first up, and by the time Cottle
and the others had their eyes open, he had the fire
started and the water in place.</p>

<p>“I’m as stiff as a starched collar,” groaned Gus as
he arose; “if it’s all the same, I’ll sleep in a bed
to-night.”</p>

<p>“You won’t see a bed for several weeks I’m
afraid,” laughed Mr. Whyland; “that is, unless
you want to turn back.”</p>

<p>“Turn back? Not much! I think this is a jolly
good lark!” And that was the end of Gus’s
grumbling.</p>

<p>They were soon on their way. As Cottle had
said, the road now became little more than a wagon-track,
crossed and recrossed in many places.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>“It is lucky Cottle is along,” said Mr. Whyland
to Oliver, as they dropped a bit behind. “We could
never find the right track by ourselves. To me half
a dozen appear to be the right ones.”</p>

<p>“That is so,” returned the boy. “It isn’t like a
city with a signboard at every corner. One could
get completely lost without half trying.”</p>

<p>“We must keep close together. I will warn your
friend too. Should one or the other stray away, much
time might be lost in coming together again.”</p>

<p>The path was now up the side of quite a steep
mountain. It was full of huge bowlders from around
which the rain had long since washed all the sand
and gravel. To one side grew small trees and thick
bushes, while on the other was a steep incline, leading
far below to a raging mountain torrent.</p>

<p>“Rather a dangerous place,” observed the boy as
he gazed down into the rushing waters; “if this
mule should take a false step”—</p>

<p>“But they never do, as far as I ever heard,” said
Mr. Whyland. “They know the danger quite as
well as the rider.”</p>

<p>Instead of getting better the road grew worse, until
Cottle stopped and allowed those in the rear to
catch up.</p>

<p>“This path has been partly washed away since I
was over it before,” he said. “You want to be careful.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
If it gets much worse, we will have to turn
back and take another road that is better, but nearly
twice as long.”</p>

<p>“We will follow you,” said Mr. Whyland. “We
trust ourselves entirely in your hands.”</p>

<p>After this they kept close together. The mules
no longer stepped forward with ease. Each head was
down, and every foothold was tested before the step
was taken.</p>

<p>Narrower and narrower grew the path until it was
scarcely two feet wide. Here the decline on the one
side became little better than a precipice.</p>

<p>At last Cottle came to a halt.</p>

<p>“It is no use,” said he; “we will have to take
the other path around this mountain. Last week’s
storm has ruined this road for good. Can you turn
around or back to that small turnout?” he asked of
Oliver, who was in the rear.</p>

<p>“I’ll try,” replied the boy. “I guess I had better
get off and lead Dobbins.”</p>

<p>“Be careful,” Mr. Whyland warned him.</p>

<p>“Yes, be careful,” said Cottle; “that mule ain’t
the kindest critter in the world.”</p>

<p>Throwing the reins on the animal’s neck, Oliver
essayed to slide to the ground. As he did so, Dobbins
shied nervously to one side.</p>

<p>“Look out there!” yelled Cottle. “Catch him
quick!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, yes! Catch him!” echoed Mr. Whyland,
while Gus sat still, too terrorized to speak.</p>

<p>Oliver tried to catch the beast as bidden, but again
Dobbins shied.</p>

<p>The movement threw the boy to the very edge of
the path. He tried to save himself, but it was useless;
and <a href="#i_fp160">the next instant his body disappeared over
the edge</a>!</p>

<small>IN THE MOUNTAINS.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Without an instant’s warning, Oliver Bright found
himself in a situation that thrilled him with horror.
As he went over the edge of the narrow path he did
his best to save himself, but, as has been told, it was
useless; the grass he clutched came out by the roots,
and then he found himself going down and down,
he knew not where.</p>

<p>He turned over and over as he rolled, and uttered
several wild cries—cries that fairly pierced the heart
of Gus, Mr. Whyland, and Cottle the guide, who
could do nothing to save him.</p>

<p>The descent was fully sixty or seventy feet. Just
before reaching the whirling torrent below, Oliver’s
body struck a projecting rock, and this encounter,
rude as it was, undoubtedly saved his life.</p>

<p>This can be easily seen, when it is told that to
have fallen into the river would have been instant
death. The current would have dashed him directly
on the rocks, and that would have ended all.</p>

<p>But when Oliver’s body struck the rock that projected
from the decline, the blow caused it to bound<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
several feet out of its course, and in doing this he
was hurled directly into the branches of a short and
stout fir-tree.</p>

<p>By this time consciousness had forsaken him, and
his body hung among the branches, a limp, inanimate
mass.</p>

<p>“My heavens! the boy will be killed!” cried Mr.
Whyland, who was the first to recover from the awfulness
of the situation.</p>

<p>“It’s a bad tumble,” replied Cottle, shaking his
head.</p>

<p>As for Gus he could not say a word. Suppose
Oliver was killed? The very thought sent shiver
after shiver through his frame.</p>

<p>“We must hurry down to him somehow,” went on
Mr. Whyland; “how can it be done?”</p>

<p>“I think there is a path a little way ahead,” replied
the guide. “Come, we will dismount and see.”</p>

<p>His directions were instantly followed. Sure enough,
a little distance farther there was a break where a
tiny watercourse led to the river below.</p>

<p>It did not take them long to reach the bottom of
the ravine, and once down there they hurried back
with all possible speed.</p>

<p>“He must have come down somewhere about here,”
said Cottle, as he came to a halt; “but I don’t see
anything of him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I hope he hasn’t been carried down the river!”
cried Gus; and he added in a low tone, “Poor Olly!
if he is dead, oh, what will I do? It will break his
father’s heart!”</p>

<p>“I don’t see—” began Mr. Whyland, and then,
happening to glance up, he ejaculated, “here he is
up in the tree!”</p>

<p>In a moment more Cottle had climbed the tree
and had the body on the ground. He loosened Oliver’s
collar, and applied his ear to the boy’s heart.</p>

<p>“Is he—is he alive?” faltered Gus.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; but he has had a severe shaking up.
Bring some water from the river.”</p>

<p>Gus hurried off to do so. When he returned Oliver
was just stirring. Mr. Whyland put some of the
water on his face and hair.</p>

<p>Presently Oliver opened his eyes and sat up.</p>

<p>“Where am I?” he asked faintly. “What—what—oh,
I remember now! I didn’t go into the
river, did I?”</p>

<p>“No, thank God, you did not,” replied Mr. Whyland.
“It was a most miraculous escape!”</p>

<p>“How do you feel?” asked Gus. “I hope there
are no bones broken.”</p>

<p>“I feel sore all over. Give me some of the water.”</p>

<p>Cottle gave him a drink, and carefully noted its effect.</p>

<p>“Did it hurt when it went down?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then that’s all right. If you were injured internally
you couldn’t drink without having a pain.
Better take it easy for a little while though.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to,” replied Oliver with a suppressed
groan; “I’m too sore to move much. Where is my
mule?”</p>

<p>“Up on the path with the others. I’ll turn them
back to the other trail. All hands take it easy for
an hour or so till I get back.”</p>

<p>In a moment more Cottle was gone. Gus and Mr.
Whyland sat down beside Oliver, one on either side.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad, Olly,” cried the stout youth. “When
I saw you go over my heart jumped right into my
mouth, just as if I was going myself. Crickety!
but it was a nasty fall and no mistake!”</p>

<p>In half an hour Oliver arose slowly to his feet. As
he had said, he ached in every joint, and his head, too,
felt queer, but otherwise he was all right.</p>

<p>“But I never want another such tumble,” he declared.
“I shall never forget it if I live to be a
hundred years old!”</p>

<p>At the specified time Cottle came back. He had
succeeded in turning the mules, and had found a
much better path a little to the northward.</p>

<p>“Then we might as well go on,” said Oliver;
“there is no use in wasting time here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<p>“Do you feel able to go on?” asked Gus.</p>

<p>“I think so. We can try it any way.”</p>

<p>Mr. Whyland could not help but smile at the boy’s
determination.</p>

<p>“You have lots of backbone!” he declared. “Well,
since you say so, we will go on; but if you find it
hurts you, don’t hesitate to speak.” And up to the
path above they went, and then back to where Cottle
had left the mules.</p>

<p>Walking pained Oliver considerably, and he was
glad enough when he could sink once more into his
easy saddle. Then the guide went to the front, and
the onward journey was resumed.</p>

<p>By two o’clock in the afternoon they had passed
around the northern base of the mountain, and were
entering a long and narrow valley. Before them
loomed a long, low range of hills, and Cottle said
that the Aurora mine was located just beyond, and
about forty miles to the north-east.</p>

<p>The scenery upon all sides was magnificent, and
had Oliver’s mind been free from anxiety, and his
body without pain, he would have enjoyed it to the
fullest extent. Even as it was, he sometimes reined
up his mule to drink in the prospect.</p>

<p>“Beats the East all to bits!” he said to Gus as
they rode side by side.</p>

<p>“You are right. I would rather take a trip about
here than go to Europe ten times over.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>

<p>“And yet you will find thousands of people who
prefer the latter trip,” put in Mr. Whyland. “Some
have gone to Europe half a dozen times and never
come West once.”</p>

<p>“I guess they go because it’s the style,” suggested
Cottle. “But as for me, Uncle Sam’s domain is
good enough every time.”</p>

<p>The riding was now much easier and all hands
urged the mules to a better gait.</p>

<p>“If we can, we will make Billy Ford’s cabin before
we halt,” said the guide.</p>

<p>“And who is Billy Ford?” asked Oliver.</p>

<p>“An old timer who keeps a sort of cross-roads
store and tavern,” laughed Cottle.</p>

<p>“A store! ’Way out here!” cried Gus. “Who
in creation can he have for customers?”</p>

<p>“Miners come to him for forty miles around. Billy
has been here since prospecting first began. We
won’t buy much from him because he is so terribly
high in prices; but you had better patronize him a
little, just to keep him in good humor.”</p>

<p>On and on they went, until, just as the sun was
setting over the mountain they had just passed, Cottle
pointed to a cabin far ahead.</p>

<p>“There is Billy’s,” he said.</p>

<p>In a quarter of an hour they had reached the spot.
It was where the road crossed a small mountain stream.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
Ford’s cabin proved to be a rude structure of logs
plastered over with mud. A sign hung outside, stating
that provisions and drinks were to be had on reasonable
terms.</p>

<p>As they rode up, the proprietor came out, gun in
hand. As soon as he saw Cottle, however, he lowered
the weapon.</p>

<p>“Hello, Felix! Who you got thar?” he asked.</p>

<p>“A party bound for the mines, Billy,” was the
guide’s reply; and he jumped down and held out his
hand.</p>

<p>“So? All right.” The two shook hands. “Going
to squat here over night?”</p>

<p>“Reckon to, unless you say no.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. Come in, gents,” and Ford
turned to the others. “Suppose Cottle’s told you all
about my ranch?”</p>

<p>“He told us something,” said Oliver as he dismounted.</p>

<p>The party were soon on the ground, and Cottle
turned to take care of the horses. As he did so,
Ford walked up to him.</p>

<p>“Say, Felix, it’s a wonder you didn’t strike this
place last night,” he said with a laugh. “There
might have been some fun if you had. Your old
boss, Colonel Guerotaz, stopped here.”</p>

<small>A STORM IN THE MOUNTAINS.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Oliver Bright was as much surprised as Cottle to
hear Ford’s words. Colonel Mendix had stopped at
the place only the night before! They were indeed
close upon his heels.</p>

<p>Without replying, the guide turned an inquiring
look towards the boy. Oliver at once spoke up.</p>

<p>“You say Colonel Guerotaz was here last night?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Ford. “Know the man?”</p>

<p>“I know of him. Was he alone?”</p>

<p>“No, no; had two new hands with him.”</p>

<p>“Did they have any baggage? I mean heavy
stuff?”</p>

<p>“Not as I know of. Are you off to see him?”
went on the keeper of the store curiously.</p>

<p>“We are,” replied Oliver. “What time did the
colonel leave?”</p>

<p>“At sunrise this morning. Oh, he’s a spry fellow,
I can tell you.”</p>

<p>Oliver said no more, but walked back to Mr. Whyland
and Gus.</p>

<p>“Colonel Mendix is just a full day’s journey ahead<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
of us,” he said. “I wonder if it is likely that we
catch up with him before we reach the mine.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that would be advisable,” was Mr.
Whyland’s reply.</p>

<p>“Nor I,” responded Gus. “I don’t want to face
the man until we reach the mine.”</p>

<p>“We will tell Cottle of this. He can easily keep
a lookout ahead.”</p>

<p>As soon as the mules were cared for, the little
party entered the store. It was a place scarcely
twenty feet square, lit up in the daytime by three
dirty windows and at night by a couple of smoky
lamps.</p>

<p>The air was redolent of the aroma of various groceries,
mixed with the smell of tobacco and liquor.
Oliver remained about five minutes, and then went
out and sat down on the little porch to catch his
breath.</p>

<p>Behind the store there was one room, used by Ford
as a dwelling. In this apartment all hands were invited
to spend the night with the proprietor; but all,
with the exception of Cottle, declined with thanks,
Oliver saying that now they were in the mountains,
they would prefer to sleep in the open.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t sleep in that place if I was paid for it,”
he told Gus, when the three were alone.</p>

<p>“Nor I,” replied the stout youth. “Crickety! the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
smell was strong enough to walk! I don’t see how
Ford stands it.”</p>

<p>“It is a matter of habit,” laughed Mr. Whyland.
“Just as the families of a wild tribe all live in one
wretched hut. With so much pure air around, one
would think they would want just that and nothing
else, but the opposite is the fact.”</p>

<p>However, not wishing to offend Ford, they had
him furnish them with supper and breakfast, and before
leaving, Mr. Whyland purchased from him a
pound bag of tobacco for a dollar, which he afterwards
presented to Cottle for use in his stump of a
pipe.</p>

<p>Half an hour after sunrise on the following morning
they bade the storekeeper good-by and were off.
Each one was in the best of spirits, though Oliver was
still sore from his frightful tumble.</p>

<p>The little stretch of plain before them was soon
crossed. At its termination they came to a narrow
defile, between a small mountain on one side, and some
rugged rocks and bushes on the other.</p>

<p>“Were it not for these natural roadways the journey
from one place to another would be next to impossible,”
said Mr. Whyland as they rode along.</p>

<p>“I believe you,” said Oliver. “However would
we be able to climb this mountain, small as it is?
No mule could ascend such a steep place.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure about that,” put in Cottle;
“it is wonderful what a mule can do when put to it.
But such an undertaking breaks them all up.”</p>

<p>At noon they found themselves still in the pass.
Gus stated that he was growing tremendously hungry,
but Cottle said they had better wait for dinner.</p>

<p>“We want to get out of this pass as soon as possible,”
he added; “in a couple of hours it won’t
be a safe place to be in.”</p>

<p>“Why, what do you mean?” exclaimed Oliver.</p>

<p>“I see some bad looking clouds over there,” replied
the guide, pointing with his finger. “We are
going to have a storm some time this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“A storm!” cried Gus.</p>

<p>“Yes; and I won’t be surprised if it is a heavy
one.”</p>

<p>“Then why not seek shelter somewhere here?”
went on Gus. “I am sure we can keep dryer here
than out in the open.”</p>

<p>“Not much!” responded the guide. “If that
storm is heavy this place will be a mighty dangerous
one. Come, we must hurry along.”</p>

<p>“And why dangerous?” asked Oliver as they urged
the mules forward.</p>

<p>“On account of the rocks that roll down the mountain,
and the wind. At times it is something fearful.
We must lose no time. I was in a storm down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
in the Gedney Pass one day in September two years
ago, and I will never forget it. Hark!”</p>

<p>As Cottle concluded, a low rumble far to the north-west
was heard, a rumble that seemed to rise and
fall like the billows of the ocean.</p>

<p>“It’s coming!” cried the guide. “Forward as
fast as you can!”</p>

<p>His directions were followed instantly. The mules
seemed to understand the situation and did their best.</p>

<p>On and on they went, the sky above them each
instant getting blacker and the roll of thunder coming
nearer. Then a puff of heavy wind swept past
them.</p>

<p>“It is coming!” shouted the guide. “Hurry up,
all of you.” And away he went faster than ever.</p>

<p>Oliver and Gus were close behind. Mr. Whyland
brought up the rear. Another rush of wind followed,
and then it seemed to grow black as night.</p>

<p>“We are going to catch it and no mistake!” exclaimed
Oliver. “I wish we were out in the open
once more.”</p>

<p>“Half a mile farther will fetch it,” cried Cottle.</p>

<p>He could say no more, for at that instant a flash
of lightning fairly blinded them. Then came a
deafening roar of thunder that lasted fully five minutes,
followed by a perfect deluge of rain.</p>

<p>Oliver pulled his hat far down over his head and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
eyes, and buttoned his coat up tightly. But it was
no use; in one minute he was soaked to the skin.</p>

<p>“Don’t stop!” called out Cottle during a brief
lull. “We must get out of here if we wish to save
our lives!”</p>

<p>Nobody replied; but every one understood the importance
of his words.</p>

<p>Oliver’s mule was now getting winded, and the boy
had great trouble in making him keep up the pace.
He patted the animal and spoke encouragingly to
him, but all to no purpose. In a moment more they
had dropped behind.</p>

<p>“What is the trouble?” asked Mr. Whyland, slacking
his pace.</p>

<p>“The mule won’t go. He is winded, I guess.”</p>

<p>“He must go. Keep him at it.”</p>

<p>Another clap of thunder followed. The mule
pranced about wildly. All the others had gone
ahead, and Oliver was left alone to deal with the
animal.</p>

<p>“Whoa!” he called out. “Whoa, Dobbins!”</p>

<p>But Dobbins would not stop his prancing. Another
clap of thunder, and a mass of rocks came crashing
down close to the spot where the mule stood.</p>

<p>In a twinkling his hind feet rose in the air, and
his rider was unseated and thrown to the ground.
Then Dobbins tore away, leaving Oliver to his fate.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
<small>THE AURORA MINE AT LAST.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Oliver now found himself in an exceedingly perilous
position. The rain came down in such a torrent
that he could not see five yards ahead, and what had
become of his mule he did not know.</p>

<p>He picked himself up from the spot where he had
been thrown, and crouched for a moment under an overhanging
rock. As he did so, a blinding flash of lightning
swept by, and on the instant a tall tree that stood
not over two hundred feet away was split from the
top to the bottom, and was wrapped in a blaze of
fire!</p>

<p>The sight nearly made Oliver faint. The air was
charged with a peculiar odor,—probably sulphur,—and
the boy gasped for breath.</p>

<p>“Struck by lightning!” he muttered. “Thank
Heaven I was not nearer!” It took him several moments
to recover sufficiently to proceed on his way.
Then he stumbled on and on, falling half a dozen
times. And all the while the rain came down in
sheets, until he thought a perfect deluge had overtaken
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span></p>

<p>“I wonder where the others are?” he muttered.
“No use to call; my voice couldn’t be heard a dozen
steps away in this wind.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes passed. He had progressed probably
the eighth of a mile. The stones of the road cut into
his soaked boots, and made his feet pain as they never
had before. He was all out of breath, and sat down
under an overhanging rock.</p>

<p>“If this is life in the mountains I want none of it,”
was his thought. “If a rock should roll down upon
me I would be crushed into a jelly.”</p>

<p>He wished earnestly that he was once more with
the others. What if he should miss them by the
way? The thought made him shiver.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be alone out here for a million dollars!”
he cried aloud, and his voice sounded strange
to himself. “I must hurry and catch up by some
means.”</p>

<p>As he concluded, a peculiar noise ahead made him
start. What was it? Some wild animal?</p>

<p>He sincerely hoped not. His weapons were all upon
the mule’s back, and if attacked he would be next to
defenseless.</p>

<p>The sound came from a bend above. For several
seconds Oliver hesitated about proceeding.</p>

<p>And yet it had to be done. He must go ahead;
there was no other way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<p>While hesitating, the sound was repeated. But this
time it was louder and more capable of interpretation.
In spite of himself the boy gave a low laugh.</p>

<p>“Dobbins!” he cried. And in a moment more he
was around the bend.</p>

<p>True enough, there stood the mule, shivering and
braying all to himself.</p>

<p>It did not take Oliver long to climb upon the animal’s
back, and once there he urged the beast on as
before. Dobbins had had a short rest, and struck out
well.</p>

<p>“Now to find the others. They cannot be so very
far away. Get up, Dobbins, you rascal!”</p>

<p>In a few moments more the narrow pass came to an
end and Oliver found himself upon an open plain.
He tried to peer through the darkness and rain.</p>

<p>To the southward he thought he could discern three
figures moving about. Were they his party?</p>

<p>“I ought to be sure before I move away,” he told
himself. “Suppose I fire a shot and see?”</p>

<p>No sooner had the thought entered his mind than
he decided to act upon it. The sound of the report
had hardly died away before an answering shot was
wafted back to him.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness I have found them,” he cried.
And the next instant he was off at the top of Dobbins’s
speed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span></p>

<p>Gus came out to meet him. Despite the rain the
stout youth’s face was covered with a broad smile.</p>

<p>“Crickety! but I’m glad you’re here!” he called out.
“I was afraid the storm would swallow you up.”</p>

<p>“And it nearly did,” replied Oliver; “I’ve had a
narrow escape.”</p>

<p>By the time they had reached the others the rain
began to abate as rapidly as it had come on. The
dark, angry clouds broke up in all directions, and presently
a glint of sunshine appeared far in the west.</p>

<p>“Always act that way,” said Cottle. “This is the
blamedest region for such showers ever was.”</p>

<p>All gathered around Oliver to hear what he had to
say, and all agreed that his escape was miraculous.</p>

<p>“After this we must be more careful to keep together,”
said Mr. Whyland gravely. “He might
have lost his life and none of us been the wiser. I
did not miss you, Oliver, till we were out here.”</p>

<p>“Nor did any of us,” put in Cottle. “I tried to
look back for you, but the rain was too thick; I
couldn’t see a thing.”</p>

<p>In half an hour the sun was shining as brightly as
ever. As the day was warm all hands took off their
coats and hung them on their mules’ backs to dry.</p>

<p>“We may as well make camp before any of us take
cold,” remarked Mr. Whyland; “it is only about an
hour from sunset.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<p>“There is a good spot just a quarter of a mile
farther,” said Cottle. “We will be there in five
minutes.”</p>

<p>Quarter of an hour later they were in camp. The
tent was pitched on a bit of high, sandy ground, and
a roaring fire was started just outside of the entrance.
The following day was Sunday. Cottle would have
gone ahead as usual; but the boys and Mr. Whyland
voted to remain in camp and take a rest, and let the
mules do the same.</p>

<p>“Besides,” said Oliver, “nothing will ever be gained
by breaking in on the Sabbath when there is no absolute
necessity for so doing.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” said Gus.</p>

<p>“I like to hear young men talk like that,” put
in Mr. Whyland; “it shows a proper spirit. Let us
spend the day as it should be spent.”</p>

<p>“Not many men keep the day out here,” remarked
Cottle. “Many of them don’t know what a Sunday
is after they once leave the city.”</p>

<p>The entire Sunday was a beautiful one. After
breakfast Mr. Whyland read several chapters out of
a Bible he had brought along, and offered prayer;
and then they took a long walk about the neighborhood,
leaving Cottle lying in the door of the tent
smoking his pipe and watching the mules.</p>

<p>“As I have heard remarked, this is God’s country,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
and so in very truth it is,” said Mr. Whyland.
“Some day all these hills will be dotted with farmhouses
and barns, and the sound of the thresher and
reaper will be heard on every hand.”</p>

<p>“It is a rich country,” returned Oliver. “I would
not wish for better farming lands than these.”</p>

<p>“And yet all who come here do so only for gold
and silver,” put in Gus.</p>

<p>“It will not be so long. The people who mine
must live, and somebody must raise the stuff for
them to eat.”</p>

<p>“In that direction lies the Aurora mine,” went on
Mr. Whyland, pointing with his finger to the south-east.
“Cottle says we ought to reach it by Tuesday
noon.”</p>

<p>“Colonel Mendix has already arrived there, I
suppose,” said Oliver. “Won’t he be surprised when
we appear on the scene?”</p>

<p>“No doubt he will do all in his power to outwit us.”</p>

<p>“But he shall not do it,” said Oliver decidedly.
And he meant it from the bottom of his heart.</p>

<p>Sunrise on Monday found them once more on the
way. Riding was now much easier, and they made
rapid progress, all traveling side by side.</p>

<p>That night they encamped near the edge of another
mountain torrent. It was a beautiful spot,
the prettiest they had yet stopped at.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span></p>

<p>Oliver sat on a flat rock, his chin in his hands.
It was the last night’s camp on that lone spot.
What did the morrow hold in store?</p>

<p>All through the night he slept but little. Once
Gus awoke and noticed it. Rolling over, he whispered,—</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, old boy; it will be all right, mark
my words.”</p>

<p>“I trust so,” replied Oliver. “I wish it was
over.”</p>

<p>He was the first to be stirring, and he cautioned
Cottle to halt as soon as the mining district should
appear in sight. Then in a short quarter of an
hour they were off.</p>

<p>On and over the plain, five, ten, fifteen miles.
Then they began slowly to ascend a steep but small
mountain, halting at the top.</p>

<p>“There,” said the guide, pointing to a spot not a
quarter of a mile away, “<a href="#i_fp180">there is the Cortez mine,
and just below it is the Aurora</a>!”</p>

<small>AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The Aurora mine had been reached at last!</p>

<p>Oliver Bright, as he sat on his mule, drew a
long breath. His tedious journey had come to an
end.</p>

<p>“The Aurora mine!” he repeated. “That way,
beyond that row of buildings, is the Aurora mine?”</p>

<p>“It is the shaft leading to it,” said Cottle. “It
is a very peculiar mine, running, as it does, parallel
to the mountain for some six hundred feet. I could
never understand how Colonel Guerotaz, as he is
called, could abandon it, seeing as it paid so well;
but when he approached it from the extremity of
the Cortez I began to smell a mouse, and what you
have told me makes it as plain as day. He will be
greatly surprised to see you.” And the guide gave
a long, low laugh.</p>

<p>“I have been thinking I had better go down
alone,” said Oliver. “He will know you, Mr. Whyland,
and you too, Cottle.”</p>

<p>“I have been thinking the same thing,” replied
the former. “But you had better take Gregory with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
you, and if you get into any trouble fire off your
pistol. You know what to say.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” replied Oliver; for he and Mr. Whyland
had had too many conversations on the matter
for him to make any mistake.</p>

<p>A little later Oliver and Gus rode forth from the
bushes in which the confab had taken place, and
headed directly for the group of buildings below.</p>

<p>“Hope you ain’t nervous, Olly,” said the stout
youth, as they moved on at a rapid gait.</p>

<p>“I am anxious but not nervous,” was the low reply.
“This Colonel Mendix has grossly wronged
my father, and I intend to have matters set straight.”</p>

<p>“I’m feeling mighty funny myself—”</p>

<p>“If you want to go back—” began Oliver.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it; not if I knew I was going to
have my head taken off,” cried Gus. “What, after
all you did for me on the Polly Eliza! Not much!”
and he spurted on ahead.</p>

<p>In a few minutes they had arrived at the row of
buildings. Only a single man was in sight, the
rest probably being at work.</p>

<p>“Is Colonel Men—I mean Colonel Guerotaz anywhere
about?” asked Oliver.</p>

<p>The man stared at them.</p>

<p>“Reckon you’ll find him over there in the office,”
was the slow answer. “Anything particklar?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>

<p>But Oliver did not reply. Riding over to the
building indicated, he dismounted, followed by Gus,
and rapped loudly upon the door.</p>

<p>“Come,” said a sharp voice from the inside; and
they entered.</p>

<p>It was a plain room, furnished with a desk, a
small safe, and half a dozen chairs. In one corner
lay a number of specimens of ore; and that was all.</p>

<p>In front of the desk sat Colonel Mendix, deep in
the perusal of a number of written statements. He
glanced up in surprise as the two entered. He had
expected to see some of his own workmen.</p>

<p>“Hello! Who are you?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Is this Colonel Guerotaz?” asked Oliver, advancing
as calmly as he could, though his heart beat as
it never had before.</p>

<p>“That’s my name,” was the short reply. “And
you are?”</p>

<p>“A couple of mine-hunters all the way from San
Francisco,” returned Oliver. “This is my friend Mr.
Gregory. My name is Oliver.”</p>

<p>The Spaniard bowed.</p>

<p>“I am pleased to meet you, Mr. Oliver,” he said,
falling into a natural mistake, as Oliver had intended
he should. “You are looking for a mine?”</p>

<p>“Yes; a mine that was located a number of years
ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span></p>

<p>“And what mine was that?”</p>

<p>“The Aurora.”</p>

<p>The Spaniard turned pale, and clasped his hands
together.</p>

<p>“I—I—know of no such mine around here,” he
faltered.</p>

<p>“Not at all?” asked Oliver sharply.</p>

<p>“No, no; I am quite sure. What makes you think
there is a mine by that name near here?”</p>

<p>“I did not say it was near here, did I?” asked
the boy innocently.</p>

<p>“Oh!” Colonel Mendix breathed a sigh of relief.
“I thought—”</p>

<p>“But I am told it is quite near here,” went on
Oliver.</p>

<p>Colonel Mendix jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>“Who told you that?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Mr. Arthur Bright.”</p>

<p>“Arthur Bright! I don’t know such a man.”</p>

<p>“His son says you do.”</p>

<p>“His son!” the man staggered back. “Where did
you meet his son?”</p>

<p>“His son was in San Francisco about a week ago.”</p>

<p>“I—I—did not know he had a son,” faltered the
colonel.</p>

<p>Oliver could not help but smile, the man was so
confused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>“If you do not know the man it is not likely that
you would know he had a son,” he said.</p>

<p>Colonel Mendix jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>“I want none of your smart sayings, young man!”
he said.</p>

<p>“And I haven’t anything very smart to say,” replied
Oliver. “I only want to know the location of
this Aurora mine.”</p>

<p>“What do you want to know that for?”</p>

<p>“I want to find out about it for Mr. Bright.”</p>

<p>“Did he send you?”</p>

<p>“No; but he could not come himself, and so I
came for him. He said the mine was somewhere
out here, and I promised to look it up.”</p>

<p>Colonel Mendix looked at Oliver sharply for a
moment.</p>

<p>“Who ran this mine?” he asked slowly.</p>

<p>“Colonel Mendix.”</p>

<p>At the mention of that name the Spaniard could
not help but flinch. But he quickly recovered.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, I knew Colonel Mendix,” he replied.
“He went to South America several years ago.”</p>

<p>“He did?”</p>

<p>“Yes. If you are after the mine he opened I can
tell you all about it. But it is of small consequence,
I can assure you.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<p>“Because the mine is utterly worthless. Colonel
Mendix had great hopes of it proving a bonanza and
sunk a good deal of money in it. The investment
made him a poor man.”</p>

<p>“Was it all his own money he used?”</p>

<p>“I think he had some Eastern capitalists interested;
but when he saw the mine was a failure he never
tried to settle the matter; simply sold off the machinery
to pay off the indebtedness, and cleared out.”</p>

<p>“Have you heard from him since?”</p>

<p>“Never.”</p>

<p>“And where is the mine? I would like to be
able to tell Mr. Bright that I had seen it.”</p>

<p>“It is about a quarter of a mile below here, and
half-way up the mountain. Follow the wagon-track
that leads to the south and you cannot miss it.”</p>

<p>Of course Oliver knew that the man was telling
a falsehood; yet he wished to hear all the colonel
might have to say.</p>

<p>“And the claim is quite abandoned?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Entirely. It would not pay to reopen it under any
consideration. This mine of mine, the Cortez, pays
but poorly, and it is by far the best in the district.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, we will take a look at the mine you
speak of and then come back,” said Oliver; and the
two withdrew, leaving the Spaniard gazing after them
earnestly.</p>

<small>COLONEL MENDIX IS ASTONISHED.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“I believe that man would lie when the truth
would do!” burst out Gus, when they had ridden
out of hearing. “Of course you don’t take any
stock in what he says.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed! Even if Cottle had not told us all
about his little trick, I would never believe him after
he had passed himself off as somebody else. We
will ride on in the direction he indicated as far as
he can see us, and then turn back to where we left
Mr. Whyland.”</p>

<p>This was done; and fifteen minutes later they had
rejoined their friend and the guide.</p>

<p>“I was getting a little worried,” said the former;
“well, what luck?”</p>

<p>Oliver told him of what had occurred.</p>

<p>“The old fraud sent you off to the Johnny Brill
mine!” burst in Cottle. “Brill opened it, and when
it was nearly played out, turned it over to Mendix;
why I never knew, excepting that the Spaniard wanted
to palm it off as the Aurora.”</p>

<p>“That was probably his scheme,” said Mr. Whyland.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
“He is a deep one. I wish I knew just where
he keeps all of his papers.”</p>

<p>“There was a safe in the place called the office,”
replied Oliver.</p>

<p>“Yes; but he may have some place in San Francisco—”</p>

<p>“Guess not,” returned the guide. “I reckon you
will find all you want right in that little building.”</p>

<p>“If we could only get hold of them—”</p>

<p>“I’d ride in and take possession,” continued Cottle.
“If you have a right to the mine I wouldn’t wait a
minute.”</p>

<p>“We have if it’s the right mine,” said Oliver.</p>

<p>“I can vouch for it that it is. I know every foot
of the ground around here.”</p>

<p>“Here is the description of the mine,” said Oliver,
producing the papers. “Listen, I will read them off;”
and he did so.</p>

<p>“That’s it to a T, and no mistake. The Cortez
is only a blind to the regular mine. I’d swoop down
on him.” And the guide shook his head decidedly.
He would have been better pleased if there had been
a regular muss with a bit of shooting added.</p>

<p>“I wish I knew where the sheriff of the county
was located,” began Mr. Whyland.</p>

<p>“The sheriff is Dan Shattock,” replied Cottle. “He
lives over to Fennel Gulch.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span></p>

<p>“And how far is that from here?”</p>

<p>“About thirty-five or forty miles.”</p>

<p>“If I gave you a letter to him could you bring
him back with the necessary papers?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Only Dan will want pay in advance.”</p>

<p>“I will give you the hundred dollars that you
have earned. You can pay him whatever is necessary,
and I will pay you back with good interest.
Come, I will write the letter without delay.”</p>

<p>“Yes, do,” said Oliver. “Colonel Mendix may
smell a mouse and try to head us off ere long. He
had not expected to be disturbed, but now you can
rest assured he will be on his guard.”</p>

<p>Mr. Whyland sat down immediately to compose
the letter. It was not a very long epistle, but it was
just to the point. Oliver read it over and offered
several suggestions that the other deemed valuable,
and then the letter was folded and placed in Cottle’s
hand.</p>

<p>“I’ll be off at once,” said the guide; and he mounted
his mule.</p>

<p>“And how long before you will be back?” asked
Oliver.</p>

<p>“Depends on where I catch Dan Shattock. Not
longer than three days, I reckon.” And with these
final words Cottle rode away.</p>

<p>“I trust he will be lucky enough to find his man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
at once,” said Mr. Whyland. “Having the sheriff
here will be a great help to us.”</p>

<p>“I suppose Gus and I had better ride back to
carry out the deception,” said Oliver. “Mendix
will be looking for us.”</p>

<p>“And I will remain in camp down here in the hollow,”
said Mr. Whyland. “I think as long as the
colonel does not see me we will be safe. But if you
need me, fire off a shot as before agreed.”</p>

<p>A moment later Oliver and Gus were on the return.
They followed the track they had come by,
and in less than half an hour had passed the abandoned
mine, and were once more at the Cortez’s
office.</p>

<p>“Well, are you satisfied now?” asked the colonel
as he came out to meet them.</p>

<p>“That mine is certainly abandoned,” replied Oliver,
raising a light laugh, far, however, from natural.</p>

<p>“Yes; it is utterly worthless.” Colonel Mendix
paused. “Was that all you were hunting in this
region?”</p>

<p>Oliver hesitated for a moment, not knowing exactly
what to say in return.</p>

<p>“It was all we wanted to know about the mine,”
he answered slowly. “But you tell me that mining
around here doesn’t pay?”</p>

<p>“Hardly. It did years ago, but we have nearly
reached the end.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span></p>

<p>“If you have no objection I would like to take a
look around your mine,” said Oliver. “I was never
in a mine just like this.” He did not deem it necessary
to say that he had never been in a mine of any
kind. “It must be an interesting sight.”</p>

<p>Colonel Mendix frowned slightly. The idea of
these two suspicious young men prowling about the
place did not suit him.</p>

<p>“It is not such an amusing sight,” he replied with
a short laugh.</p>

<p>“Still you don’t object, I suppose,” said Oliver.</p>

<p>“Oh, no; I—I—will send for a man to show you
through. It is not often we have visitors away out
here. Take seats while I send for the man.”</p>

<p>He indicated a couple of chairs, and the two boys
seated themselves. Oliver’s heart beat like a trip-hammer.
What would be the result of this strange
visit to the mine?</p>

<p>“Have you good stout boots?” went on Colonel
Mendix; “you need them in a place like this.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we always wear tough sole-leather,” laughed
Gus. “We have been knocking about too long to
do otherwise.”</p>

<p>This reply put the colonel off the track once more.
But he went on,—</p>

<p>“You are from the West then?”</p>

<p>“We came from Central America,” replied Oliver;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
“but we have been spending some time in San
Francisco.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I see.”</p>

<p>There was a short pause after this. Oliver felt the
colonel’s sharp eyes bent full upon him, and to avoid
confusion he bent over and began an examination of
the sole of one of his boots.</p>

<p>“That is getting a little worn,” he said to Gus;
“I guess I will pare that edge off with a knife.”
And getting out his penknife he began to do so.</p>

<p>While at work several men came into the office
and asked for instructions. Oliver became much interested
in what was said, referring as it did to the
transfer of some heavy machinery from San Francisco
to the mine. He laid down his knife, pulled
up his boot, and drank in every word.</p>

<p>From this he learned that on the day following a
party of six men with eighteen mules were to start
for the coast. On arriving there, the machinery was
to be put up in packs, loaded on the mules, and
then brought to the mine. The trip would occupy
the best part of a month.</p>

<p>This conversation gave the boy considerable satisfaction.
It would decrease the force of men in the
mine by six, and this would count for much if the
sheriff should have any trouble in establishing their
claim. He trusted that Colonel Mendix would not
discover their intentions before the start was made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<p>When the men were about to leave, the colonel
motioned for one of them to remain.</p>

<p>“Here, Restrepo, I want you to show these two
young men through the mine,” he said. And then
followed some instructions in Spanish to the effect
that the trip should be a short one and nothing of
importance should be shown.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Si, signor</i>,” replied the fellow, touching his cap.</p>

<p>“This man will show you through,” said the colonel,
turning to the two; and there was nothing left
to do but to follow the man out; and this they did.</p>

<p>No sooner were they gone and the door closed, than
the colonel sank back in his chair in deep thought.</p>

<p>“That Oliver’s face reminds me strongly of one
that I have seen before,” he muttered to himself.
“I do not like the manner of either of them. Bah!
I must be getting nervous. What can two boys do?”</p>

<p>He was about to turn again to the papers before
him, when his eyes rested upon the penknife Oliver
had left lying on the floor. Half abstractedly he
picked it up.</p>

<p>“Oliver Bright!” he ejaculated, as he read that
name upon the handle. “That boy must be Arthur
Bright’s son! Ah, I see it all! He is spying upon
me!” He clinched his hands. “I must attend to
this at once!” he cried.</p>

<small>IN THE AURORA MINE.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The guide that Colonel Mendix had furnished the
two boys was a tall, swarthy Spaniard of sinister aspect.
He had been in the colonel’s employ for many
years, and was his favorite tool upon all occasions.</p>

<p>“Follow me, please you,” he said brokenly; “we
go down quick.”</p>

<p>He led the way from the office across a strip of
yard piled high with crushed ore and dismantled
machinery of old-fashioned pattern, and at length
they came to the opening of the mine, directly into
the side of the mountain.</p>

<p>“It must be dark in there,” said Gus as they passed
the threshold.</p>

<p>“Not dark, many lamps,” said Restrepo. “Come,
close by me, please you.” And leaving the pure light
of day behind they entered the passageway.</p>

<p>For the instant the boys could see nothing. But
gradually their eyes became accustomed to the gloom,
and then they distinguished far ahead a number of
flames flickering like so many yellow stars in a dark
sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span></p>

<p>“This is the first lode,” said the Spaniard. “Pay
good many year ago; not much now.”</p>

<p>“And how many others are they?” asked Oliver
eagerly.</p>

<p>The man hesitated. He had been cautioned not to
say too much.</p>

<p>“Only few,” he replied evasively. “I show, please
you.” And on they went.</p>

<p>They had nearly reached the lights when a man,
carrying a lantern, came running towards them.</p>

<p>“Back!” he cried. “Half a minute! Back!”</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” exclaimed Gus in sudden
terror.</p>

<p>“Fire blast,” answered Restrepo. He turned and
motioned them back.</p>

<p>They lost no time in returning to the entrance. A
few seconds later a dull roar was heard, followed by
the sound of falling rocks.</p>

<p>“All right now,” said the Spaniard; “no more for
an hour.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t want to be around when any of these
blasts go off,” shuddered Gus. “Might kill a fellow
without half trying.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” replied Oliver. “Ever kill any
one?” he asked of Restrepo.</p>

<p>“Killed two last year,” was the grim reply. “But
their fault, no other. They not run away far; stand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
close; blast go off; both get heads blowed away, please
you.”</p>

<p>“Horrible!” cried Oliver. And he made a mental
vow that should he ever become master of the mine
he would take extra precautions against such tragedies
occurring.</p>

<p>“I suppose some men get so reckless they don’t
value their lives,” remarked Gus. “Mr. Whyland
was—”</p>

<p>Oliver gave him a sharp pinch in the arm. “Take
care what you say!” he whispered.</p>

<p>In an instant Gus understood the slip he had
made.</p>

<p>“Oh!” He drew a deep breath. “Mr. <em>Ryder</em>
told me they don’t seem to care whether they live
or not.”</p>

<p>Oliver was relieved to hear his friend turn the
slip he had made.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. <em>Ryder</em> ought to know,” he replied.
“But I should think every man’s life would be
sweet to him,” he went on.</p>

<p>“And so it is,” broke in a voice behind them.</p>

<p>Both boys started. Turning, they beheld Colonel
Mendix close at hand.</p>

<p>“I thought I would come down and show you
through myself,” he said blandly; “it is not often that
I have visitors, and I think it my duty to show you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
all the points of interest. Restrepo, you may go to
work again.” And he added some words in Spanish
to the man, who departed at once.</p>

<p>Oliver could not help but feel uncomfortable.
Why this sudden change in the colonel’s manner?
Did he suspect anything?</p>

<p>Then he began to wonder if Colonel Mendix had
overheard the slip Gus had made. He sincerely
hoped not. It might prove the cause of trouble.</p>

<p>But the colonel appeared to suspect nothing. He
led the way, chatting gayly, pointing out this object
and that in the most natural manner, until both
boys were completely disarmed.</p>

<p>“Never seen a mine like this before?” he said.
“Well, it is a sight well worth a good many miles
of travel. Of course to us it is a very humdrum
business, blasting and crushing day in and day out.”</p>

<p>“And do you never leave the mine?” asked
Oliver.</p>

<p>“Very seldom. Once in a while I take a trip to
’Frisco on business, but that is all. I have no family
ties, and this life here suits me just as well as
any other.”</p>

<p>Before the boys were aware an hour had slipped
by. Colonel Mendix led them into a number of abandoned
passages, and they did not see the miners
quit work for the day and leave the mine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<p>“Now, if you can do a little climbing, I will show
you the richest lode in the mine,” said the colonel
at length, when he was sure they were left alone.</p>

<p>“I guess I can climb anywhere you can,” replied
Oliver with a laugh; “and I can help my friend
along.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you had better stay behind,” suggested
Colonel Mendix to Gus.</p>

<p>“No, no, I’ll go wherever he does,” cried the
stout youth.</p>

<p>A look of disappointment crossed the Spaniard’s
face.</p>

<p>“Very well then. Follow me.” And he led the
way up a narrow passage, and through a small hole
into a rough sort of chamber.</p>

<p>“We can only get to it this way,” he said. “To
leave it one must take a different route.”</p>

<p>“How is that?” asked Oliver.</p>

<p>“Because to reach it this way one must drop
down a distance of fifteen feet, and it is too much
of a job getting back. But the other way the return
is very easy, though rather long. Here is the place
to drop, over these rocks. Do you think you can
do it?” And he held the lantern over the edge.</p>

<p>“I guess I can,” replied Oliver; “but—but—”</p>

<p>“But what?” asked the colonel sharply.</p>

<p>Oliver did not know what to reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span></p>

<p>“Here, I will hold the lantern for you,” continued
Colonel Mendix. “You go over first and I will follow,
and we will catch your friend.”</p>

<p>This seemed fair enough, and getting down, Oliver
swung himself over the ledge and dropped.</p>

<p>About ten feet below his feet struck some slanting
projection; but it was too slippery with water
to catch a footing, and he went down fully fifteen
feet farther.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he cried. “I—”</p>

<p>“Now you,” cried the colonel to Gus. And before
the latter could say a word he found himself
pushed to the brink and sent rolling over. He
clutched the edge with his hands, but was unable
to draw himself up, and went over just as Oliver
had done.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” he demanded. “You
pushed me over!”</p>

<p>“It is a trap,” whispered Oliver, helping Gus to
his feet. “Are you coming down?” he called to
the man above.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I shall,” was the mocking reply.
“That is one of the worst pits in the mine, and if I
once got in I am afraid I would never get out again.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean—” began Oliver, with his heart
in his throat.</p>

<p>Colonel Mendix gave a loud laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span></p>

<p>“I mean, Oliver Bright, that I have found you out,”
he replied. “You thought you were smart, but you
are not smart enough to outwit me. You are completely
in my power. It may be that you do not
realize it just at present, but you will, later on, never
fear. You cannot get the best of me as easily as you
may imagine.”</p>

<small>A PERILOUS SITUATION.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Oliver Bright was never so taken aback as when
he found himself and Gus Gregory in a deep pit in the
Aurora mine, and in Colonel Mendix’s power.</p>

<p>The turn of affairs was so unexpected that for a
moment he could not utter a word. The villainous
colonel had found him out, and what the result would
be no one could conjecture.</p>

<p>“American boys are not always so smart as they
think themselves,” continued the Spaniard, as he seated
himself upon the ledge above and looked down upon
the two.</p>

<p>“What do you intend to do?” asked Oliver.</p>

<p>“That is my business,” was the cold answer. “First,
however, I want to ask you a few questions.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we won’t answer them,” returned Gus
sharply. He ached all over from the tumble he had
had.</p>

<p>“You had better,” was the pointed reply. “Both of
you are completely in my power; I hold your very
lives in my hands.”</p>

<p>Oliver could not help but shudder. As for Gus, he
gave a half-suppressed groan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span></p>

<p>“First, I want to know who sent you out here?”
went on Colonel Mendix. “Was it Arthur Bright?”</p>

<p>Oliver was silent.</p>

<p>“Did you hear my question?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“And why didn’t you answer?”</p>

<p>“I shall say nothing until you help us out of this
pit and conduct us back to your office,” was the boy’s
determined reply.</p>

<p>“What! do you defy me?”</p>

<p>“I do. You have no right to treat us in this
fashion.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! right! Might is right out here. You
must answer my question.”</p>

<p>“And I refuse to do so.”</p>

<p>“Think well. I am not a man to be trifled with.”</p>

<p>“I don’t need to think it over. I shall not answer a
single question till we are back in your office.”</p>

<p>“Then you will tell me everything?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I will.”</p>

<p>“I would not trust you. I think I had better leave
you here.”</p>

<p>“Leave us here!” cried Gus in terror.</p>

<p>“Exactly. Leave you here to the darkness and the
rats.” Colonel Mendix gave a cold laugh. “Oh, I
can tell you the rats are nice companions, especially
when they crawl all over you and nip you in the legs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<p>Gus gave a shiver. The idea of a rat attacking him!</p>

<p>“Perhaps <em>you</em> would like to tell something,” went
on the colonel.</p>

<p>“Don’t you do it,” put in Oliver.</p>

<p>“Not much,” replied Gus. “If you don’t say anything,
you can depend upon it neither will I.”</p>

<p>“Come, what do you say?” went on the Spaniard
impatiently.</p>

<p>“I refer you to my friend,” said Gus. “He is the
only one to do the talking for this crowd. Your
threats don’t frighten me for a cent,” he added boastfully,
more to keep up his courage than aught else.</p>

<p>“And you would rather be left here to starve to
death?”</p>

<p>Neither of the boys replied.</p>

<p>“Very well then,” said the colonel, rising; “I will
leave you to yourselves for the night. Perhaps in the
morning you will have a different story to tell.”</p>

<p>“You are going to leave us here?” asked Oliver.</p>

<p>“Yes; unless you tell all I want to know.”</p>

<p>“I will tell nothing.”</p>

<p>“Then good-night to you. There is no use trying
to escape. Even if you manage to get up here again, I
shall take pains to close the passage in such a way that
you cannot get out.” And, with another loud laugh,
Colonel Mendix took up his lantern and disappeared,
leaving the two boys in total darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span></p>

<p>“Crickety, but we are in a pretty mess and no
mistake!” said Gus, as the last ray of light left
them.</p>

<p>“You are right; but don’t let us despair,” returned
Oliver. “I think I did what was right; but it is
rough on you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mind me,” said Gus. “I owe you a good
deal. The question is, what is best to be done?”</p>

<p>“Listen!”</p>

<p>They did so. Far in the distance they could hear
the echo of Colonel Mendix’s footsteps, and the moving
of several stones, and then all became silent.</p>

<p>“Do you think he spoke the truth about the rats?”
asked Gus with a shudder.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Gus; there may be rats here. But
he evidently wanted to frighten us all he could.”</p>

<p>“Ugh! it makes me shiver to think of them. I
wish we had a light.”</p>

<p>“I have some matches. I will strike one and
see what kind of a place this is.”</p>

<p>“Hold on till I tear some pages out of my note-book
and make lighters out of them. We want to
save our matches.”</p>

<p>“That’s so.”</p>

<p>Gus soon had the lighters made. Then Oliver
struck a match, and they gazed about them.</p>

<p>The place into which the Spaniard had led them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
was a veritable pit, some thirty or forty feet in diameter.
On all sides the walls rose to the height
of twenty feet or more—steep walls, which caused
Oliver to shake his head sadly as he gazed at them.</p>

<p>“Pretty tough job to climb them,” he said; “but
perhaps it can be done.”</p>

<p>“It will <em>have</em> to be done. You do not intend to
stay down in this confounded hole?”</p>

<p>“Not a minute longer than I have to. Remember,
Mr. Whyland will grow anxious if we do not return
in a reasonable time.”</p>

<p>“Colonel Mendix puts me in mind of a snake.
His eyes are so cold and calculating they make me
shiver every time I look at them.”</p>

<p>“Now if we only had a lamp,” said Oliver.</p>

<p>“But we haven’t.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if we could get this piece of wood to
burn,” went on the other, holding a stick he had
picked up.</p>

<p>“You might, if you split up the end. Here, let
me do it with my knife.”</p>

<p>As Gus spoke Oliver felt in his pocket for his
knife.</p>

<p>“My knife is gone!” he exclaimed. “I left it
in the colonel’s office when I fixed the sole of my
boot.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t it have your name on?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span></p>

<p>“Why, of course! I see it all now! Colonel Mendix
had an easy job finding out who I was! What
a fool I was to leave the knife lying there!”</p>

<p>“Never mind; it can’t be helped now, Olly, so
let us make the best of it. Here, I have the stick
ready.”</p>

<p>Gus handed back the stick. Oliver lit another
match and applied it to the split end. It was rather
damp, but at last caught fire.</p>

<p>“There! that is better than nothing!” declared
the stout youth. “It is bad enough to be down
here, without being in the dark. Now let us look
around and see what the chances for escape are.”</p>

<p>Oliver did not reply. He was looking at a name
that was cut on the stick. The name was <span class="smcap">James
Barr</span>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.<br />
<small>SEEKING DELIVERANCE.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>As will doubtless be remembered, James Barr was
the name of the surveyor who had been sent by Mr.
Bright to assist Colonel Mendix in locating the Aurora
mine.</p>

<p>Oliver’s surprise can therefore be imagined when
he saw this same individual’s name cut in the stick
his friend had picked up to be used as a firebrand.</p>

<p>“James Barr!” he cried. “It must be the same.
How wonderful!”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?” asked Gus.</p>

<p>Oliver told him.</p>

<p>“And he is reported to have lost his life in a flooding
of the mine,” he concluded.</p>

<p>“It is strange,” said Gus; “but still it counts
for nothing. Barr might have cut his name on that
stick in a moment of idleness.”</p>

<p>“Of course; but it shows that he was here. And
if that is so it is pretty good proof that this is the
Aurora mine.”</p>

<p>“That is so. I did not think of that. I thought
that was all settled before.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span></p>

<p>“There is nothing like being doubly sure. But
come, let us see if we cannot find some means of escape
while the stick lasts. When that is gone we
will be in darkness, for I see no more wood about.”</p>

<p>Holding the stick up sideways, so that it would
burn and light the way, the two advanced on a tour
of discovery.</p>

<p>It soon came to an end. On all sides were the
same perpendicular rocks.</p>

<p>“Not much encouragement there,” remarked Oliver
grimly. “But we must find some way out. Here,
hold the torch, while I see if I cannot scale this
side.”</p>

<p>Gus took the extended torch, and Oliver made a
desperate leap forward.</p>

<p>He gained a hold, and arrived three-quarters of
the way up. Then he slipped, and rolled down to
his friend’s feet.</p>

<p>“Not that time,” he cried; “but I think I can
do it.”</p>

<p>Again he tried, and again the same result.</p>

<p>“This clumsy coat and the heavy boots bother
me,” he declared. “I will take them off.”</p>

<p>“How am I to get up, even if you do?” asked
Gus dolefully.</p>

<p>“One thing at a time, Gus. Here, take the things.
One, two, three!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span></p>

<p>With a mighty spring Oliver made the jump.
Half way up he paused. Was he going to fail
again? No; he clung fast, reached up overhead, and
drew himself up into the gloom.</p>

<p>“All right!” he called back. “Throw me the stick
and then perhaps I can help you up.”</p>

<p>Gus flung the firebrand as best he could. Oliver
caught it and stuck it in a crevice.</p>

<p>“Now make the jump up the rocks and catch my
hand,” he called down, and he leaned as far as possible
over the edge.</p>

<p>Gus did so. Three times he failed. The fourth,
Oliver caught his wrist, and a moment later, puffing
and blowing, both stood on the edge of the pit, but
on the side opposite to that where they had entered.</p>

<p>“Crickety! I don’t want to try any more such
jumps!” panted Gus. “I’ll be out of wind for a
month.”</p>

<p>“And I trust we don’t get into any more such
holes,” laughed Oliver. “But the thing of it is,
have we bettered ourselves by the movement?”</p>

<p>“That we can’t tell till we see where this passage
leads to,” returned the other, pointing to a narrow
opening in the rocks. “If that is only a blind we
are as bad off as we ever were.”</p>

<p>“I think that if I were down here alone I would
go mad,” said Oliver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span></p>

<p>“I am sure I would. Heou! let us get out as
soon as we can!”</p>

<p>Taking up the light, they proceeded down the narrow
passage. It was a low cavern, so low that in
many spots even Gus, the shorter of the two, was
compelled to stoop.</p>

<p>“Hold on,” cried Oliver who was in advance;
“here is a stream of water. We don’t want to be
drowned!”</p>

<p>“Indeed not! Is it deep?”</p>

<p>Oliver made an examination with his hands.</p>

<p>“Quite deep. But here is a spot that is not very
broad. I can jump it easily, and I guess you can
do the same.”</p>

<p>Holding out the firebrand, he made the leap, and
landed safely upon the other side.</p>

<p>“Now you,” he called to Gus; and in a moment
they were together again.</p>

<p>It was not long before they entered what appeared
to be a large chamber. Here, from some place far
above, streamed in a faint light.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried Oliver. “There is open daylight
at last! If it was not for the fact that the
sun has set it would be lighter still. Come, let us
go on.”</p>

<p>But they could not do so. On the opposite side
of the chamber, if such it might be called, could be
seen nothing but the solid rocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<p>“Blocked!” cried Gus in dismay, and Oliver
echoed the cry. “What shall we do now? Go
back?”</p>

<p>“No, no! I think—” Oliver sprang aside and
pointed to a corner. “Oh, Gus, what is that?”</p>

<p>The stout youth looked towards the spot indicated,
and turned pale. And small wonder; for
there, lying on its back, was the skeleton of a human
being.</p>

<p>Both of the boys approached it slowly. It was
the first time they had seen so ghastly an object,
and it filled them with awe.</p>

<p>“Some poor miner that wandered in here and
could not get out,” said Gus. “See, nothing but
his bones remain to tell the tale!”</p>

<p>“And if he wandered in here and could not find
any way out, what are we to do?” asked Oliver in
almost a whisper, so horrible was the thought.</p>

<p>“Don’t—don’t say that!” cried Gus; “my nerves
are already unstrung. We must do what we can,
and do it quickly too; for it will soon be night
and then morning, and if we don’t find anything
to eat—” And he finished with a groan.</p>

<p>Oliver put his hand to his brow. What should
they do next? Which way should they turn?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.<br />
<small>A VALUABLE FIND.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>As Oliver stood thinking, a bright object lying
upon the ground attracted his attention. He picked
it up. It proved to be a silver match-box.</p>

<p>“Hello! here is something!” he said, and turned
it over in his hands. Upon one side were the initials
J. B.</p>

<p>“This must have belonged to James Barr also,”
he went on. “I wonder if that skeleton—”</p>

<p>He did not finish. Gus shook his head.</p>

<p>“It looks that way,” he said. “Open the box and
see if there is anything in it.”</p>

<p>Oliver did so, and brought forth several pages that
had been torn from a diary.</p>

<p>“Here is something,” he said. “Hold the light so
that I can see what it is.”</p>

<p>With trembling hands he unfolded the sheets and
scanned them over. He had hardly read a dozen
lines before he gave a loud cry.</p>

<p>“Oh, what shame, what baseness!” he cried.
“This is the dying statement of James Barr, in
which he says that Colonel Mendix has enticed him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
hither and made him a prisoner; that he is dying
with a fever, caught some time before, and that the
colonel wished to get him out of the way for fear
he may expose the fact that the Cortez mine lies
wholly within the Aurora mine limits; and that
Colonel Mendix, <em>alias</em> Guerotaz, is in reality a Spanish
counterfeiter named Guito!”</p>

<p>Oliver was both pained and delighted over the
discovery he had made,—pained that James Barr had
come to so heartless a death, and delighted to know
that he now had the means within his power to
cause Colonel Mendix’s immediate arrest, providing,
of course, he could gain his own liberty.</p>

<p>“What a rascal that Spaniard is!” he exclaimed.
“Just think of his luring poor Barr to his death
while the man was sick with the fever! I would
like nothing better than to give the brute a sound
thrashing, and he deserves a thousand!”</p>

<p>“Never fear but what the law will take care of
him,” replied Gus. “They are not letting counterfeiters
off so easily, to say nothing of Barr’s death,
and this mine swindle.”</p>

<p>“If we were only out of this hole!”</p>

<p>“That’s just it. But gracious, I don’t know how
to turn!”</p>

<p>“Let us go back to that watercourse,” suggested
Oliver after a moment’s thought. “That must
lead somewhere.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span></p>

<p>“You are right. I never thought of that; but
if there is escape that way, I wonder why Barr
didn’t—”</p>

<p>“He was probably too sick with the fever,” said
Oliver, partly to keep his own courage up. “Come
on. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nil desperandum!</i>”</p>

<p>In a few minutes they were back at the watercourse.
Here they found a narrow passage, scarcely
a foot in height, leading upwards.</p>

<p>“Shall we try it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Certainly. Try anything.”</p>

<p>So Oliver crawled into the hole on his hands and
knees, and Gus followed. They had not gone far
before they found the rock giving way in many
places to dirt.</p>

<p>“I take that for a good sign,” said Oliver. “I
think we are near the top of the hill, but how far
from the opening I cannot tell.”</p>

<p>For ten minutes more they continued on their
painful journey. Then Oliver came to a halt.</p>

<p>“Nothing but rock ahead,” he said.</p>

<p>Both he and Gus were ready to cry with vexation.
Had they taken all this trouble in vain?</p>

<p>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“That is all I can see. Wait till I dig over it
where there is a bit of dirt.”</p>

<p>Oliver went to digging vigorously. But with his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
bare hands it was slow work, and he was about to
give up in despair, when suddenly his hand struck
an opening beyond.</p>

<p>“There is a passage!” he exclaimed. “Wait till
I enlarge the opening.”</p>

<p>He worked away for fully quarter of an hour more.
Then he squeezed his way through and helped the
stout youth to do the same.</p>

<p>“This is better!” remarked Gus, when they found
themselves in a much larger passage on the other side
of the opening. “Now let us hurry; the stick shows
signs of going out.”</p>

<p>There was no need of urging; Oliver was traveling
at the height of his speed. Up and up they went,
the passage growing wider as they advanced.</p>

<p>“Hold up,” cried Oliver, suddenly stopping short.
Then he put the firebrand behind him and peered
ahead. “Hurrah! I see the light of evening shining
into the other end of this passage. We are out of it
at last!”</p>

<p>And such proved to be a fact; for five minutes
later they emerged, and found themselves at the very
top of the mountain, at a spot where they could look
down upon the mine buildings.</p>

<p>“Thank God we are out of that hole!” cried Oliver.
“Oh, how good it seems to be in the open air
once more!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<p>“Won’t that Spaniard be taken aback when he
learns that we have escaped,” said Gus. “He was
so positive he had outwitted you!”</p>

<p>“We must find our way back to camp at once. Mr.
Whyland will be getting anxious concerning us.”</p>

<p>“You are right. Let’s see, I think the spot is in
that direction.”</p>

<p>“So do I, just beyond the three tall trees.”</p>

<p>A minute later, after a whiff of fresh air, they struck
out for the camp. They had hardly appeared in sight
when Mr. Whyland came running out to meet them.</p>

<p>“You have been gone longer than I expected!”
he exclaimed. “Where are your mules?”</p>

<p>“We have got a long story to tell,” said Oliver
and Gus in a breath. And sitting down beside the
sheltered fire Mr. Whyland had started, they related
their adventures.</p>

<p>Of course the gentleman was much astonished.</p>

<p>“It sounds almost too strange to be true,” he said.
“Let me see that statement that was left by James
Barr. No doubt it will prove of the utmost importance
to us.”</p>

<p>He took the leaves, and by the light of the blazing
fire read them aloud. All hands listened with rapt
attention.</p>

<p>They contained but little more than what Oliver
had intimated, saving the telling of where much of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
the proof of Colonel Mendix’s villainy could be found,—in
San Francisco, and in a number of places in
Brazil.</p>

<p>“I guess we have <em>him</em> in <em>our</em> power now,” said
Mr. Whyland when the reading was finished. “If
only Cottle was here, we might go ahead.”</p>

<p>“I think we can afford to wait a day,” laughed
Oliver, he felt so relieved to be safe in camp once
more. “Colonel Mendix still thinks we are in the
mine pit.”</p>

<p>“That is so. If he saw you now he would think
you were a ghost.”</p>

<p>“I would like to play ghost on him and scare him
into a fit,” said Gus. “He deserves it.”</p>

<p>“He will get more than a ghost scare when we
get after him,” observed Oliver sternly. “He will
find out that leaving us there to perish is no light
offense.”</p>

<p>“I cannot understand how I was so blind to his
real character when I went into the mine deal with
him,” put in Mr. Whyland.</p>

<p>“That proves he is a born actor as well as rascal,”
said Oliver.</p>

<p>“I can’t help but feel sorry for that James Barr,”
observed Gus. “I suppose he trusted Mendix just
as much as anybody did.”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly,” rejoined Oliver. “If he had stood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
in with the Spaniard, it isn’t likely he would have
been left to die in that horrible fashion.”</p>

<p>“I presume you two lads are pretty well fagged
out,” said Mr. Whyland a few minutes later. “You
had better turn in and try to get a good sleep.”</p>

<p>“Fagged out don’t express it,” yawned Gus. “I
am half asleep all over, as the saying goes.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be stiff enough in the morning, I’ll warrant,”
laughed the gentleman. “You are not accustomed
to such climbing as you had to do in the
mine.”</p>

<p>“No.” Gus shuddered. “My, but it was awful!
I didn’t dare to think of not getting out for fear
my hair would turn white!”</p>

<p>“I can realize now the horror of a cave-in in a
coal-mine,” put in Oliver. “It’s one of the most
dreadful things that can happen to any one.”</p>

<p>“You are right, my lad,” said Mr. Whyland. “But
come, there is no use to dwell upon what you have
gone through. Try to forget it, and give your mind
and body a chance to recuperate.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to try it, anyway,” grumbled
Gus, as he prepared to retire. “If I get a nightmare,
just poke me in the ribs somebody.”</p>

<p>“We will!” laughed Oliver.</p>

<p>“You see, I don’t want to go through it again,
even in my sleep.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span></p>

<p>After this there was quite a bit more of talking,
and finally they retired, to rest, if not to sleep.</p>

<p>On the following morning as they were getting
breakfast, they were surprised to see a horseman approaching
from the direction of the mine.</p>

<p>“Who can it be?” questioned every one.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it’s the colonel,” said Oliver. “Suppose
you hide, Mr. Whyland, and let only Gus and I meet
him.”</p>

<p>“A good idea.”</p>

<p>The gentleman stepped behind some rocks. As he
did so the horseman came nearer, and they saw that
it was indeed Colonel Mendix.</p>

</div>


<p>“Good-morning, Colonel,” began Oliver as they
went forth to meet their visitor, though with pistol
in hand.</p>

<p>The Spaniard nearly fell from his horse.</p>

<p>“What, you!” he shrieked. “You!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Colonel Mendix, I and my friend, as you
see. You did not have us quite so much in your
power as you thought.”</p>

<p>“How—how did you escape?” faltered the
Spaniard.</p>

<p>“That is our business.”</p>

<p>The man’s brow darkened.</p>

<p>“What do you want here, any way?” he demanded.
“You have no right to hang around my
mine.”</p>

<p>“Your mine? You mean my father’s mine.”</p>

<p>“Bah! Not so. Your father’s mine is abandoned.”</p>

<p>“My father’s mine is here, and in full operation.
The Cortez and the Aurora mines are one and the
same.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span></p>

<p>“Who says so?”</p>

<p>“Felix Cottle for one—”</p>

<p>“His word is worth nothing. He is—”</p>

<p>“He tells the truth.”</p>

<p>“Right you are,” said a voice from behind; and
turning, the two beheld the guide, who had just ridden
up.</p>

<p>“Back already?” exclaimed Oliver.</p>

<p>“Yes; and all O. K.,” replied Cottle with a knowing
wink. “Collared my man on the fly.”</p>

<p>“Cottle!” cried Colonel Mendix, changing color.</p>

<p>“Yes; just in time to see you get your deserts,”
with a short, dry laugh. “Reckon we are square
now, Colonel.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“That there young man will tell you, him and
Mr. Whyland.”</p>

<p>“Whyland!” The colonel was deadly pale now.
“Is he—”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is here,” said a calm voice; and the
gentleman stepped forward. “Colonel Mendix, when
we parted in the East years ago, I guess you did
not expect that we would meet some day out here.”</p>

<p>The Spaniard bit his lips. He was trembling with
fear.</p>

<p>“I—I—what do you want?” he faltered.</p>

<p>“We want our rights,” replied Oliver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span></p>

<p>“There is nothing here for you.”</p>

<p>“I think there is,” returned Mr. Whyland. “Mr.
Shattock!” he called out, and a tall, sharp-eyed
stranger rode from under cover.</p>

<p>“The sheriff of the county!” muttered Colonel
Mendix, and on the instant his backbone seemed to
desert him.</p>

<p>It was an exciting moment for all. To Oliver
Bright it was a time of triumph. The termination
of his quest was at hand, full of the promise of
success.</p>

<p>As for Colonel Mendix, it took the Spaniard several
seconds to recover from the shock he experienced
when the sheriff appeared upon the scene.
He saw at once that matters had taken a most serious
turn.</p>

<p>“Well, Colonel Guerotaz, this appears to be a
grave business you have been engaged in,” said the
sheriff, as he dismounted from his horse and strode
over to where the Spaniard sat.</p>

<p>“I do not know what you are talking about,” replied
Colonel Mendix as stiffly as he could.</p>

<p>“You don’t?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is simply this: That you have done
everything in your power to defraud Mr. Whyland
here and one Arthur Bright out of their lawful share<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
in a certain mining scheme connected with the
Aurora mine—”</p>

<p>“Not so,” cried the colonel. “The Aurora mine
is one of no value, just as represented to them.”</p>

<p>“They are willing to swear otherwise, at least Mr.
Whyland is, and Felix Cottle is willing to testify—”</p>

<p>“I don’t care. I have my rights. My word is as
good as—”</p>

<p>“And there is other proof,” put in Oliver. “James
Barr—”</p>

<p>Colonel Mendix jumped up as if shot.</p>

<p>“James Barr! James Barr is dead.”</p>

<p>“We know that. And we also know how he came
to his death.”</p>

<p>The Spaniard started.</p>

<p>“But his dying statement remains—”</p>

<p>“His dying statement? Why, he was drowned in
the mine—”</p>

<p>“No, not drowned, but made a prisoner while suffering
from fever,” replied Oliver. “And when you
shut us up in the pit in the mine we came across his
skeleton, and near it found a statement in a match-box
for safe-keeping.”</p>

<p>“It is false.”</p>

<p>“It is the truth. That statement is now in Mr.
Whyland’s possession. Perhaps he will read it to
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<p>“That is not necessary,” said that gentleman. “I
will put the statement in Sheriff Shattock’s hands. It
is enough to say that it proves our claim to what
is known as the Cortez mine, as well as the Aurora,
and also that Colonel Guerotaz, <em>alias</em> Mendix, is in
reality a noted counterfeiter named Guito.”</p>

<p>At the last words a shrill cry burst from the Spaniard’s
lips. The revelation had been so unexpected
that it completely unnerved him.</p>

<p>“You—you—” he began.</p>

<p>“You had better not say much,” suggested the
sheriff. “It may all count against you at the trial.”
He walked over and put his hand upon Colonel Mendix’s
knee. “You are my prisoner.”</p>

<p>“Your prisoner!”</p>

<p>“Exactly. You will please dismount at once.”</p>

<p>“This is an outrage—”</p>

<p>“Come, say no more. There are others who suspect
you, and I have heard before that you were
supposed to be an escaped criminal.”</p>

<p>“I will not submit. I will—”</p>

<p>“You will submit,” replied the sheriff firmly.
“Here, hold out your hands— Hello! Stop him!”
For Colonel Mendix had on the instant wheeled
around his horse, and was galloping off at the top of
the animal’s speed.</p>

<p>“Catch me, if you can!” he cried mockingly.
“Catch Cirilo Guito if you are able!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span></p>

<p>And away went horse and rider like a whirlwind.</p>

<p>“Well, by thunder!” ejaculated Felix Cottle;
“he’s going to try to sneak!”</p>

<p>“After him!” shouted the sheriff. “Come on, all
of you!”</p>

<p>“We’re with you!” responded Cottle. “He must
not be allowed to reach those hills yonder. If he
does, it will be like looking for that pin in the
haystack, and worse.”</p>

<p>Off went the sheriff and the guide, with Mr.
Whyland not far behind them.</p>

<p>Oliver and Gus stared at each other. What
should they do?</p>

<p>“Come, Gus,” cried the former. “The more the
better in a case of this kind.”</p>

<p>And he started for his animal, tethered but a
short distance away.</p>

<p>“But the camp”—began the stout youth.</p>

<p>“Must take care of itself. There is no one about
to rob us, anyway. Come.”</p>

<p>Gus needed no second urging. Indeed, he would
not have remained behind alone under any consideration.</p>

<p>It took some time to put their animals in proper
condition for use. By the time they had mounted,
the crowd ahead were just disappearing over the
brow of a low hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span></p>

<p>Side by side, the two boys urged their animals
along at top speed. Oliver had his weapons ready
for use, but trusted he would not be called upon
to use them.</p>

<p>Crack! The sharp sound of a rifle broke the
stillness. They rightfully guessed that the sheriff
had fired on the fugitive, but whether he had reached
his mark or not they could not tell. They continued
to move forward with eyes and ears painfully
on the alert.</p>

<p>The top of the hill gained, they could see Mr.
Whyland and the others climbing a rocky slope over
to the westward. Near the top of the slope, among
some scanty brush, the boys could see Colonel Mendix,
astride of his horse, urging the animal along
with hand and spur.</p>

<p>Oliver could have fired at the man with ease, but
the thought of bloodshed held him back. He wished
to capture the Spaniard as much as did any of the
others, but he would not run the risk of having
the rascal’s blood on his conscience.</p>

<p>As Oliver and Gus began the ascent of the rocky
slope Colonel Mendix appeared at the extreme top.
For a single instant he looked back and shook his
fist at his pursuers.</p>

<p>Again the sheriff fired, and so did Felix Cottle;
and this time the fleeing criminal was wounded in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
the leg. He gave a shrill cry of pain, sent back
two shots in return, both of which flew wide of
their mark and disappeared.</p>

<p>“He is gone!” gasped Oliver.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think they will get him?” queried Gus.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how they can; the woods over yonder
are so thick. But come, we may as well follow the
others;” this as the stout youth began to lag behind.</p>

<p>“I’m so stiff, from yesterday,” groaned Gus. But,
nevertheless, he urged his horse on, and they steadily
decreased the distance between themselves and Mr.
Whyland and the others.</p>

<p>From the way the sheriff headed, it was evident he
thought Colonel Mendix was trying to ride in a circle.
Sheriff Shattock’s words soon proved this.</p>

<p>“This Mendix, as you call him,” he said, “is trying
to get back to the mine. No doubt he wishes to clean
out the office-safe before leaving this section of the
country.”</p>

<p>“Then would it not be better if one of us went back
toward the mine?” suggested Mr. Whyland.</p>

<p>“I reckon it would be.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go to the mine if you say so,” put in Felix
Cottle. “I’m better acquainted around the place than
any of you.”</p>

<p>“All right; go,” said the sheriff; and at once the
guide turned back on the trail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span></p>

<p>He soon came upon the boys, to whom he explained
the situation. Gus wanted to return with him, but
Oliver was for following Mr. Whyland; and so they
went on, leaving Felix Cottle to ride on to the Aurora
mine alone.</p>

<p>“If we hurry we can catch up with Mr. Whyland,”
said Oliver. “Come, Gus; remember the chase is not
likely to last long.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best!” cried the stout youth. “Look-out,
Oliver!” he went on suddenly.</p>

<p>He dropped down on his horse’s back, and instinctively
Oliver did the same. There were two reports,
and a clipping through the leaves of the trees followed.</p>

<p>“My gracious, he’s firing on us!” gasped Gus.
“We must try to keep out of sight.” And he shuddered
so greatly that he almost fell from his saddle.</p>

<p>“To the left—where the bushes are thicker!” exclaimed
Oliver.</p>

<p>He led the way; and hanging low behind his horse’s
neck, Gus followed. Soon they were once again well
screened.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the shots fired by Colonel Mendix
had served one good purpose. The sheriff had lost
sight of the rascal; but now the reports helped the
officer of the law to locate him, and he struck off on
a side trail, with Mr. Whyland close at his heels.</p>

<p>The ground was rocky and uneven and full of loose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
stones, and the horses made but poor headway. But in
this matter they were no worse off than was Colonel
Mendix, and both were satisfied that they were making
just as good progress as the man they were pursuing.</p>

<p>Five minutes later Oliver and Gus joined Mr. Whyland
and the sheriff. They came through a belt of
timber and found the two men on the defensive.</p>

<p>“Hullo, it’s the boys!” cried Mr. Whyland. “Have
you seen anything of Mendix?” he went on anxiously.</p>

<p>“He is over to the left, in the clump of pines,”
responded Oliver. “But be careful. Did you not
hear him fire on us? The bullets whistled right over
our heads!”</p>

<p>“We heard the shots,” said the sheriff. “The
pines, eh? Then he is making for the mine without
a doubt.”</p>

<p>“Is there no way of heading him off?” asked
Mr. Whyland.</p>

<p>“I believe there is—down at the mountain torrent
some distance below here. But no time is to be
wasted.”</p>

<p>Without further words they rode on through some
low brush and over a rocky plain. While on the
latter spot, all hands kept a sharp lookout for stray
shots; but none came. Clearly Colonel Mendix had
passed down along the watercourse, just as the sheriff
had surmised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span></p>

<p>“Wait!”</p>

<p>The sheriff uttered the word in a low tone, as
he halted on the very edge of a large, overhanging
rock.</p>

<p>The others drew up behind him.</p>

<p>Leaping to the ground, Sheriff Shattock moved
cautiously to the front, and peered over.</p>

<p>“What do you see?” whispered Oliver.</p>

<p>“Nothing, as yet; but wait. If I am right, he
will come along the road, just below here.”</p>

<p>“And if he does?” put in Mr. Whyland.</p>

<p>“I reckon I’ll make him come to terms,” was the
slow but determined response.</p>

<p>A minute—and another—passed. To the boys
they seemed hours.</p>

<p>Suddenly the sheriff leaped up.</p>

<p>“Halt!” he shouted, and aimed his pistol downward.
“Halt!”</p>

<p>Looking over the edge of the rock, the others saw
Colonel Mendix riding along a narrow path beside
the watercourse.</p>

<p>At the sound of the sheriff’s voice the Spaniard
looked quickly around, but he did not slacken his
animal’s speed.</p>

<p>“Did you hear?” demanded Sheriff Shattock.
“Halt! I have a dead aim on you.”</p>

<p>At this Colonel Mendix uttered a loud cry to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
his horse, and away bound the animal on a swift
gallop.</p>

<p>The sheriff fired, and the sound of the shot, echoing
and re-echoing through the cañon, frightened
the animal below. He leaped to one side; and in a
trice horse and rider were in the mountain stream,
and being borne along by the swift current.</p>

<p>“Just my miserable luck!” muttered the sheriff.
“See, he knows enough to duck under, and thus
avoid another shot!”</p>

<p>“What is best to do now?” asked Oliver anxiously.</p>

<p>“We must go down to the slope below here and
try to head him off. Quick! there is not a moment
to lose!”</p>

<p>Again the sheriff went on, with the three others
stringing after him in single file. The flat rock was
passed, and once more they found themselves among
the loose stones and short, thorny bushes. The sheriff
was the best rider of the party, and he soon drew
ahead. Gus was the worst laggard, and he begged
Oliver not to leave him alone.</p>

<p>“This bit of the country may be full of snakes
and wild beasts,” said the stout youth. “And I
don’t want to face anything like that all alone.”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt but what there are both snakes
and wild beasts here,” returned Oliver. “But I doubt
if they molest us if we leave them alone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span></p>

<p>“But suppose a big mountain lion should leap out
after us”—</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw! Even that wouldn’t be any worse
than having Colonel Mendix use us for targets.”</p>

<p>“That’s true too!” Gus gave a groan. “It’s a
pity he can’t drown himself in that river! It would
be a good job done.”</p>

<p>“Such rascals don’t pass out of existence so easily,
Gus. But come, we really must hurry along. If
we don’t, we’ll miss Mr. Whyland and the sheriff
altogether. And I must confess I haven’t the least
idea where we are or in what direction our camp
lies.”</p>

<p>“Nor I. Well, I’ll do my best.”</p>

<p>The thought that they would be left behind and
become lost did more to urge Gus ahead than anything
else. They proceeded over the rocks on a fairly
brisk trot; and when the slope leading down to the
mountain stream was reached Mr. Whyland and the
sheriff were but a hundred yards in advance.</p>

<p>The edge of the stream was hidden by an irregular
growth of bushes, so it was impossible to see what
was beyond until these were parted. The sheriff,
finding a shallow spot, made his horse wade out into
the open.</p>

<p>“There he is!”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span></p>

<p>“Over on the opposite side! He is just crawling
up the bank behind a clump of overhanging trees!”</p>

<p>The sheriff pointed with his finger, and Mr. Whyland
and the boys, who were just coming up, saw
that he was right.</p>

<p>“Where is his horse?”</p>

<p>“Already on shore. Come; there is but one thing
to do now,” went on Sheriff Shattock.</p>

<p>“What is that?” asked the three others simultaneously.</p>

<p>“We must ford the stream.”</p>

<p>“Can we do that?” asked Oliver.</p>

<p>“Yes. Just below here it widens out and is not
over a foot and a half deep. I will show you the
spot. And we will be certain to head off our quarry,
for he cannot turn back on that side.”</p>

<p>Without giving Colonel Mendix time to discover
them they drew back behind the bushes and followed
the sheriff’s lead along the watercourse. In less than
five minutes they came to the spot he had mentioned.
Here the stream was three times its natural width
and one could have almost leaped from rock to
rock without wetting a foot.</p>

<p>The horses went over readily enough, although
they were dry, and longed to drink. But they could
not stop to humor the beasts. They reached the
opposite shore and drew up behind a convenient
bowlder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span></p>

<p>A clatter of hoofs was heard, and an instant later
Colonel Mendix dashed past on his horse, rider and
animal leaving a stream of wet behind them.</p>

<p>“Stop!” commanded the sheriff again. “You can’t
escape us now!”</p>

<p>The Spaniard muttered something in his native
tongue, and went on faster than ever, with the
others in hot pursuit.</p>

<p>“He intends to escape if he can,” said Gus. He
was completely fagged out and ready to drop from
his saddle.</p>

<p>“Come on!”</p>

<p>It was the cry of the sheriff as he made after
Colonel Mendix, riding as he had never ridden before.
He was warmed up to the chase, and meant
to end it in a very few minutes.</p>

<p>The way was a treacherous one, and the rascal
ahead was compelled shortly to slow up. Soon the
sheriff was again within hailing distance.</p>

<p>“Stop, or I’ll fire!” he commanded.</p>

<p>The Spaniard turned. He held a pistol in his
hand and pointed it at Sheriff Shattock’s head.</p>

<p>Before he could pull the trigger, the officer fired
his own weapon. The shot struck Colonel Mendix’s
horse, and the animal leaped into the air and fell
down, throwing the Spaniard over his head.</p>

<p>When they drew near, they saw that in falling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
the Spaniard had struck his head upon a sharp rock,
and that the blood was flowing profusely from a
wound in his temple. He was unconscious, and it
took fully ten minutes to bring him to his senses.</p>

<p>“I give up,” he said in a faint voice. “The fates
are against me, and I am in the hands of the law at
last.”</p>

<p>Shortly after, the whole party rode to the office
of the Cortez mine. Here the safe was opened, and
an examination of its contents proved all the statements
made against Colonel Mendix to be true.</p>

<p>Sheriff Shattock at once took charge of the criminal.
By the suggestion of Mr. Whyland he appointed
Cottle as temporary superintendent of the
mine until the law should have taken its course.</p>

<p>The situation of affairs was fully explained to
all the men at work,—some thirty in number. They
were surprised; but as none of them had ever liked
Mendix, they took the change in good part, especially
after Mr. Whyland told them that they should every
one be well rewarded if they remained true to their
duty.</p>

<p>Then Oliver and Mr. Whyland sat down to figure
out the probable value of the mine. It was a tedious,
but highly gratifying task.</p>

<p>“One hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars!”
gasped Oliver, as he surveyed the figures. “Can it
be possible?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span></p>

<p>“It is,” laughed the gentleman. “Your father will
be a rich man.”</p>

<p>“What welcome news it will be to him! This
mine was our last hope. Had it failed us we would
have been thrown upon the world without a dollar.
But I am glad for your sake also, for you did so
much towards getting our rights.”</p>

<p>“Not half as much as you, my boy. The real
credit is wholly yours.”</p>

<p>On the following day, after all necessary preparations
were made, Oliver and Gus departed with the
sheriff and the prisoner on the return. At Ford’s
store the sheriff left them, but the two boys had no
difficulty in following the trail back to Sacramento.</p>

<p>“Now for the first train home!” said Oliver.
“Father must hear the good news without delay.”</p>

<small>CONCLUSION.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Too bad! I thought there would surely be some
word from Oliver to-day.”</p>

<p>It was Mr. Bright who spoke. He sat in an invalid
chair on the side porch, propped up by soft
pillows. Donald, the man of all work, had just returned
from the post-office with the information that
there were no letters.</p>

<p>Mr. Bright was getting well rapidly, but the lines
of care were plainly to be seen upon his brow. He
started up with a deep sigh.</p>

<p>“Nearly two weeks since I received any word,” he
murmured to himself. “How slowly the time drags!
Can it be possible that he was too hopeful and that
the Aurora has proved worthless after all?”</p>

<p>He passed his hand over his brow.</p>

<p>“If that is so what is to become of us? I am
getting too old to work, and he has no trade to
which he can turn his hand.”</p>

<p>As he concluded, the latch on the gate was lifted,
and, looking up, the sick man saw Dr. Tangus enter
the yard, and walk up the gravel path.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span></p>

<p>“Good-morning, Mr. Bright,” he said stiffly.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, doctor,” was the low reply. “Take
a seat on the bench. I am sorry there is not a chair
here.”</p>

<p>“This will do very well.” The learned man paused
for a moment. “How are you feeling?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Much better, thank you. Another week and I
think I will be all right.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear it. I suppose you know the
purpose of my visit to-day.”</p>

<p>“You are after the payment of that money.”</p>

<p>“Yes. You know it was due yesterday.”</p>

<p>“I know it was. But cannot you wait a few days
longer? I am expecting word from my son by every
mail or by telegraph.”</p>

<p>“Concerning that mining scheme you mentioned?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Dr. Tangus tossed his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that amounts to much,” he said.
“You are altogether too sanguine about it.”</p>

<p>“My son Oliver—”</p>

<p>“That boy isn’t as smart as you think he is. His
going off on a wild-goose chase—”</p>

<p>“It was no wild-goose chase, doctor.”</p>

<p>“I think it was. But, of course, that is none of
my business. All I ask is that you pay the money
due.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span></p>

<p>“I cannot do that just at present.”</p>

<p>“Then I will have to put the case in my lawyer’s
hands—”</p>

<p>“At once?”</p>

<p>“At once.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bright felt a deep pang shoot through his
heart. His pecuniary difficulties were to be dragged
before the public at last.</p>

<p>“Well, if you must,” he began slowly. Then he
stopped short and half rose from his chair. That
figure hurrying so swiftly down the road towards the
house seemed strangely familiar. Was it—could it
be—“Oliver!” he cried out, “Oliver, my boy!”</p>

<p>“Yes, father, home again!” was the glad response;
and a moment later father and son were in each
other’s arms.</p>

<p>“I did not write or telegraph because I wanted
to surprise you,” said the boy. “How do you feel?”
And then, noticing Dr. Tangus, “Excuse me, Doctor,
I did not see you before. How do you do?” and
he held out his hand.</p>

<p>Dr. Tangus took it coldly.</p>

<p>“So you are back from your wild trip,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; and glad of it.”</p>

<p>“Dr. Tangus has just called for his money,” put
in Mr. Bright. “He says he must be paid at once<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
or he will go to law. Tell me the worst, my
boy.”</p>

<p>“There is no worst to tell,” replied Oliver. “Dr.
Tangus shall be paid whenever he wishes the money.
The Aurora mine has been located, and is to-day worth
one hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“Oliver!”</p>

<p>“It is true, father, every word of it. Here are
the papers to prove the fact.” And the boy drew
from his pocket a large envelope and handed it over.</p>

<p>“And your father owns an interest in this mine?”
asked Dr. Tangus. He felt mighty cheap.</p>

<p>“My father owns five-eighths of it. Of the other
three-eighths, one part belongs to the estate of one
James Barr, and the other two to Mr. Whyland of
Boston, who has very kindly loaned us his check for
three thousand dollars to help my father out of his
difficulties;” and Oliver passed the check over for inspection.</p>

<p>“Seems straight enough,” grunted the doctor. “I
will call again to-morrow. I have no more time to
spare to-day;” and catching up his hat, he left without
another word.</p>

<p>“Oliver, you have saved us from ruin!” cried
Mr. Bright with tears in his eyes. “But for you
it would have gone hard indeed with us.”</p>

<p>“I am glad the search has ended so well,” said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
the boy; “glad for your sake, and glad for my
own.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Several years have passed. Oliver is now at college,
and has for a room-mate Gus Gregory, who
is as stout and as full of good-humor as ever.</p>

<p>The Aurora mine is in active operation, managed
by competent and trustworthy men. James Barr’s
interest was purchased by Mr. Whyland, and the
money went to support the surveyor’s aged mother,
his only known relative.</p>

<p>The Spaniard, known to the reader as Colonel Mendix,
is now in prison, suffering the full penalty of the
law. Let us trust that when he comes forth once
more it will be with the determination to lead a
better life in the future.</p>

<p>Mr. Bright still lives at his old home, surrounded
with all the ease and comfort that money can procure.
Of Oliver he never tires of talking.</p>

<p>“One boy in a thousand,” he says. “Thank God
for giving me such a son in my old age!”</p>

<p>And with these words let us say good-by.</p>

<p class="cap">Washington’s earlier life
has received scant attention,
notwithstanding its possibilities. Mr.
Stratemeyer has woven into an excellent
story something of Washington’s
youthful experience as a surveyor,
leading on to the always thrilling
Braddock’s defeat. The hero, David
Morris, is several years younger than
Washington, with whom he becomes
intimately associated. Pictures of
pioneer life are given; scenes with
friendly Indians; and old-time games.</p>

<p>The story relates the doings of two young soldiers who
join the Colonial forces in a march on Fort Niagara, during
the time of the war with France, when the whole territory
between the Blue Ridge and the Great Lakes was in a
state of unrest. Many side lights are thrown into the
colonial homes, and much useful information is given of
the pioneers who helped to make our country what it is
to-day.</p>

<p class="noic">Illustrated by A. B. Shute    12mo    Cloth    Price $1.25</p>

<p class="cap">This volume relates the adventures of Dave Morris and his cousin
Henry during the two last campaigns against the French for the
possession of Canada and the territory below the great lakes. The scaling
of the heights of Quebec under General Wolfe, and the memorable
battle on the Plains of Abraham, are given in detail. There are many
stirring scenes of battle, but the tale is not all of war. Pictures of the
rough-and-ready camp life of that day are given, and there are also
adventures while fishing and hunting, and with the Indians.</p>

<p class="citefont">Since the passing of Henty and Alger, Mr. Stratemeyer controls the
field in this particular branch of literature. The chief charm of his stories
lies in the fact that an enormous quantity of valuable information, collected
from the most reliable sources, is deftly woven into the narrative
without taking away from the interest.—<cite>Philadelphia Inquirer.</cite></p>

<p class="noic">12mo    Cloth    Illustrated by A. B. Shute    Price $1.25</p>

<p class="cap">This volume tells of times in our country immediately after the war
with France for the possession of Canada. The tale is complete in
itself, but in it are introduced a number of characters which have already
figured in this series, including that brave young soldier, Dave Morris,
his sturdy cousin, Henry, and their common friend, Sam Barringford.
Pontiac, the great chief of the Ottawas, is also a leading figure and much
is told of his work in organizing his great conspiracy against the whites.
A fight with the Indians and the French in a snowstorm is especially
realistic, and the entire book carries with it the atmosphere of colonial
times.</p>

computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
